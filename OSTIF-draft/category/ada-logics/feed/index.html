										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In May and June of 2023, OSTIF and </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> worked with the open source project </span><a href="https://dapr.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dapr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on a holistic security audit. The Distributed Application Runtime (or Dapr) is a project for building distributed applications across cloud and edge. It is an easy, portable, and serverless way to build sustainable microservices across languages and frameworks with building blocks running best practices. Existing under the umbrella of the </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Dapr is an incubating project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ADA Logics team used a variety of tools and techniques to perform the security audit. Goals for the audit of the code assets in scope were to formalize a threat model, perform a manual code audit, do an evaluation of Dapr&#8217;s fuzzing suite, and carry out a SLSA review. These goals covered a range of the project’s needs and security concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The threat model visualization and documentation acted as an aid and guide for the audit and can be used for future audits and by Dapr internally. It was feasible and important for both a high-level overview and more specific models to be created about the flow of Dapr, as they became walk-throughs that informed the identification of five possible threat actors and the four trust zones of the application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dapr’s fuzzing suite received an additional five fuzzers written by ADA Logics’ team. The fuzzers were added to the project’s OSS-Fuzz integration, making them run continuously since their introduction to the code. This way, the new fuzzers can run for longer, explore more, and test the latest master branch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the process of manual code review, seven security issues were found. They were classified as four moderate, two low, and one informational issue respectively. Four of said issues were umbrella issues of a specific class that can affect multiple components in the same building block in a similar way. One of the issues was a high-severity vulnerability in a 3rd-party dependency to Dapr that was issued CVE-2023-37475, however, it did not affect Dapr in a high-severity way and was scored as moderate from the perspective of Daprs threat model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF would like to thank the team at ADA Logics, specifically Adam and David Korczynski, for their work, dedication, and final report on this audit. Our further gratitude to the Dapr community and maintainers, notably Yaron Schneider, Alessandro Segala, and Artur Souza, for their collaboration, contributions, and efforts on this audit and their project. Finally, recognition goes to the CNCF for their funding and support of open source security work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.crossplane.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Crossplane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> underwent a successful third party security audit by </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the support of Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF). Used by firms such as JP Morgan, Time Warner, and MIT Lincoln Lab, the project is considered Incubating at </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/crossplane/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Over the first half of 2023, the multi-cloud control plane for Kubernetes API was examined, reviewed, and tested before its v 1.13 release with fixes from this audit. With the ultimate goal of graduation in mind, the audit team had its work cut out for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A holistic, comprehensive audit of Core Crossplane and Crossplane Runtime repositories was performed by manual code auditing, a fuzzing suite review, the creation of a threat model, and a </span><a href="https://slsa.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400">SLSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> grade. As the threat model was built, the audit team was able to determine attack surfaces and pinch points to focus upon which directed the manual code review. For example, supply chain security issues that Crossplane experiences as an image and package manager exposes the project to the potential for threat actors to introduce supply chain attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fuzzing being performed in Crossplane (by thirteen fuzzers ADA Logics </span><a href="https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/security/ADA-fuzzing-audit-22.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">previously created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for the project!) is critical to the ongoing, continuous monitoring of the security, health, and environment of the code. An additional four fuzzers were added during this audit with an additional fuzzer improved by way of increased code coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of the sixteen issues identified during the audit, fifteen were resolved by the Crossplane. This includes two CVEs that were found during the audit. First, a high severity finding that could allow image tampering was issued as CVE-2023-38495, and second, a low severity Denial-of-Service finding labeled CVE-2023-37900. In summation, 7 low, 8 medium, and 1 high finding were reported. The singular unfixed issue is located in the alpha features of Crossplane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are so grateful to the Crossplane team for their contributions, fixes, and investment in this audit’s execution. Further thanks to ADA Logics for their report and hard work on this project with us. It’s always a pleasure to collaborate with you. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to CNCF for their financial support of this audit and ongoing open source security work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the Spring of 2023, OSTIF, </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://notaryproject.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Notary Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> collaborated on a security audit of the new Notation libraries. </span><a href="https://github.com/notaryproject/notation"><span style="font-weight: 400">Notation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a CLI project to add signatures as standard items in the registry ecosystem and to build a set of simple tooling for signing and verifying signatures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven issues were found by the audit team and remediated by the Notary Project team. A single high vulnerability identified during the engagement allowed unverified descriptors to be fetched from a remote registry. This was classified as </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33959"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33959</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Such an action could allow a malicious actor to sign or verify an artifact that could fool a user into using a malicious artifact. A solution was devised by using the library to validate descriptors as being provided by the user. Three issues (two medium and one low) were related to signature processing, using endless data attacks to cause resource exhaustion that could lead to denial of service. See </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33957"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33957</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33958"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33958</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for more details. The fix for these scenarios was uncomplicated, and can even be modified by users should it be necessary for their use of the library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The CVEs linked above were issued for three of the seven findings, and the other four received documentation to track them or CLI command flag name changes. These resolutions are in place in subsequent releases including RC-7 and 1.0.0 of Notary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Notary Project team was eager and reactive to solving reported issues, and as a result their development and release processes were tested and improved. Thank you particularly to Feynman Zhou, Junjie Gao, Pritesh Bandi, Patrick Zheng, Samir Kakkar, Shiwei Zhang, Toddy Mladenov, Vani Rao, and Yi Zha for their involvement in this audit. ADA Logics created and imparted wonderful work with this audit and report, and we are thankful to them for their part. Finally, OSTIF would like to offer our gratitude to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for their financial support of work like this and other efforts that improve open source security. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) is thrilled to announce the results of security improvements via improved fuzzing capabilities on the </span><a href="https://liblouis.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Liblouis project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by ADA Logics! Liblouis is a braille translator with expansive capabilities that runs on open source code. In 2021, the project onboarded to OSS-Fuzz to perform ongoing security testing, but the code coverage was initially low. OSTIF and ADA Logics saw an opportunity to improve a project centered around accessibility, and armed with the knowledge and ability to contribute impactful security work to Liblouis, the project moved ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">David and Adam Korczynski of </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> contributed two fuzzers and a fuzzing dictionary to the project. First of the two fuzzers addressed the input translation, and this fuzzers ability to work across diverse input is pivotal. The second fuzzer acts similarly to the first, just that it executes back translation instead of the forward translation of the other fuzzer. The dictionary, which is for both new fuzzers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">captures all of the Opcode names used for translation table construction. Just the introduction of this dictionary caused a 45% increase in code coverage the day it was implemented. In total, code coverage went from around 20% to just below 80%; with static reachability peaking at 93%, an increase of 16% from the start of engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The data, found via the ADA Logics link below, was generated and analyzed using the Introspector, an insightful tool for visualizing OSS Fuzz setups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six issues were found by these fuzzers due to improved performance and code coverage. ADA Logics expects more to come as the fuzzers continuously run, providing hardened security outcomes to protect the users of Liblouis. David and Adam included further testing area recommendations in their work for maintainers to continue improving security measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work was organized, researched, and completed not for compensation, but out of love of the community and in fulfilling a mission to improve security posture for open source projects. Open source is maintained for all, and support can and should be rendered for programs that promote inclusivity and access for all.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is Vital for Vitess!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, in collaboration with </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ada Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is proud to announce the results of a successful</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">security audit for </span><a href="https://vitess.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitess</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Born at Youtube in 2010 to help scale up database interactions, Vitess eventually moved under the umbrella of </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Native Computing Foundation,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graduating at CNCF in 2019. Used in over 50 projects, Vitess’s functions of scaling, workflow, and shard management are critical for growing applications that see thousands, sometimes millions, of users daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VTAdmin is a new aspect of Vitess, and as such the whole of the component was considered during this audit as an artifact for security review. During this audit Ada Logics ran with a five point list of goals, including manual code review, a threat model, improving Vitess’s fuzzing suite, and a </span><a href="http://slsa.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grade.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the moderate vulnerabilities that were reported, two CVEs had the potential to allow malicious users to block other users from using the full capabilities of VTAdmin or Vitess. For example, stopping others from creating shards. Two of the fuzzers created by Ada Logics for Vitess were directly inspired by these two CVEs, and were immediately implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Described further in the report are details of VTAdmin’s attack surface, SLSA compliance, and all 12 vulnerabilities disclosed during the process of the audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF extends its deep gratitude to Deepthi Sigireddi and the entire Vitess Maintainer team as well as David Korczyzski and Adam Korczynski of Ada Logics.  Further thanks to CNCF for their gracious funding of this audit and continued work in open source security.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cilium joins a </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/08/08/improving-cncf-security-posture-with-independent-security-audits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing list </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Cloud Native Computing Foundation Projects (CNCF) audited to improve security posture and help reach </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">graduated status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thanks to strategic partner OSTIF. A combination of threat modeling, manual code review and automated testing tools were used for this engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit went exceptionally well, with only a handful of medium severity and low/informational issues discovered. The most notable issue was a mutex lock discovered in the Envoy component. A full list of the issues discovered in Cilium can be found in the report at the bottom of this page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tooling Updates and Security Posture Improvements</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the engagement the ADA Logics team created fuzzers for both the project and its critical dependencies. A total of 13 fuzzers were written, including 10 for Cilium’s critical functions and policy handling, and an additional 3 fuzzers for the widely used netlink dependency. At the time of this writing, the three fuzzers for netlink have not been integrated into ossfuzz for continuous fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a lightweight threat model was developed for Cilium that helps contributors and consumers of Cilium understand from a security perspective how Cilium works, and informs users on the attack surface of Cilium, and more importantly, helps contributors to understand how changes to code as the project grows and matures can affect the security of Cilium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADA Logics team also recommended that a document covering how to use Cilium securely should be created to help users understand and manage their configuration of Cilium. The Cilium team </span><a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/23599"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is working on creating that document now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Security Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cilium meets most of the requirements for SLSA level 3 (and 4), but does not generate a provenance document with its builds. It does however generate a Software Bill of Materials with each release, and the Cilium team </span><a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/22740"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has started to actively track SLSA compliance here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank the Cilium maintainers from </span><a href="https://isovalent.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isovalent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the audit team at </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their help and collaboration on this engagement. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is happy to announce the results of the Istio Security Audit. Used by key cloud providers and technology organizations, </span><a href="https://github.com/istio/istio"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Istio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an open service mesh platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. The Security Audit was carried out by the team at </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A total of fifteen fixes were implemented as a result of this engagement, including fixes for two upstream issues in golang itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security review included building six new fuzzers for sensitive functions in Istio, manual review of the Istio codebase, and recommendations for improving the supply chain security of Istio using the SLSA model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notable findings in this review include multiple vectors for resource exhaustion, arbitrary file writes, TOCTOU issues, and recommendations to move away from a deprecated protobuf library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project resulted in 13 direct code changes, 6 improved tests, and efforts to complete a move from /gogo/protobuf (which is no longer maintained) to /golang/protobuf. Additionally, Istio added Depguard to the project in order to detect any future use of deprecated or unsafe dependencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally as a result of this audit, a problem was discovered in golang h2c that was both a resource exhaustion and request smuggling vector that could affect many projects downstream, resulting in </span><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41721</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is fixed in the latest version of golang.</span></p>
<p>The full report can be found here: <a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Istio-audit-report-v1.0.pdf">https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Istio-audit-report-v1.0.pdf</a><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to report the results for the security audits of <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core">Jackson-Core</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind">Jackson-Databind</a>. Jackson-Core and Jackson-Databind are Java projects that are widely adopted for parsing and binding data. The security review was facilitated by <a href="https://ostif.org/">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> backed by the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a> and carried out by <a href="https://adalogics.com/">Adalogics</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. The Jackson team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by requesting independent review and actively participating in the audit process.</p>
<h2>Security Findings</h2>
<p>The results of the security audit are 12 security findings (3 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low/Informational). In addition, the team at Adalogics built 10 new fuzzers (4 for Jackson-core and 6 for Jackson-databind) which led to eight new bugs being discovered. These fuzzers will run on ossfuzz for Jackson before every release, giving Jackson a long-term security benefit.</p>
<p>The two most notable issues are <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42003">CVE-2022-42003</a> and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42004">CVE-2022-42004</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-42003 Resource Exhaustion via UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS</strong></p>
<p>An unchecked deserializer could be abused to exhaust resources via nesting arrays, causing a denial of service.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-42004 Resource Exhaustion via BeanDeserializer._deserializeFromArray</strong></p>
<p>An unchecked deserializer could be abused to exhaust resources via nesting arrays, causing a denial of service. This bug has a more limited impact because it requires specific settings to be manually enabled in order to be exploitable.</p>
<p>The remaining high severity issue was an edge case that Adalogics and the Jackson team assessed has no use cases that are exploitable.</p>
<p>All of the serious issues identified through this engagement have been fixed and validated by the Adalogics team. See below for the full report.</p>
<h2>Thank You</h2>
<p>A big thank you to the Open Software Security Foundation for supporting the work and funding the audit. Furthermore, thank you to the Adalogics team for executing the audit and working with us to make and validate fixes. Also, thank you to the <a href="https://sos.dev">Secure Open Source</a> initiative for helping to compensate the Jackson team for their extensive work improving these projects.</p>
<p>Also special thanks to Tatu Salorenta, Adam Korczynski, and David Korczynski for their roles in the engagement.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s Do More to Make Open Source Better</h2>
<p>Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Everyone around the world depends on OSS, and we would love to do more security audits! If you’re interested in financially supporting this work, contact <a href="mailto:amir@ostif.org">amir@ostif.org</a>.</p>

The main components of Argo audited are: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argo Workflows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Container-native Workflow Engine</span></li>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research findings resulted in 26 security issues including 1 critical and 4 high severity bugs that were fixed. The most significant finding is an XSS injection in ArgoCD </span><a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-h4w9-6x78-8vrj"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-h4w9-6&#215;78-8vrj</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows an attacker to execute javascript code in the UI, which could allow an attacker to take admin control of the kubernetes cluster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the Ada Logics team built 7 new fuzzers to integrate into the ossfuzz testing suite for Argo that focus on security relevant functions. The Argo team and community demonstrated a strong commitment to improving the project’s security posture. See the full report and Argo team’s synopsis below for detailed information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CNCF) for funding this audit and entrusting Open Source Technology Improvement Fund to facilitate it. </span></p>
