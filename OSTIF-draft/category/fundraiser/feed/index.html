										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Amazon Web Services Supports Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director, Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc (OSTIF)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OSTIF team is absolutely thrilled to announce that we’ve reached an agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide $500,000 in funding. The funding from AWS will help OSTIF scale our ability to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical open source projects. In particular, the goal is to improve the sustainability of upstream projects commonly used in the open source ecosystem.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2022 proved to be an impactful year for OSTIF, as we executed over 20 security engagements for critical open source projects; resulting in over 35 Critical/High Vulnerability patches and upwards of 165 total security improvements. Approximately 50 automated security tools, such as fuzzers and CI implementations, were developed to continuously monitor these projects, providing long-term benefits to security posture. The support from AWS will allow us to continue to do that into 2023 and scale our ability to help critical open source projects that everyone depends on.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Amir Montazery, Managing Director, OSTIF</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Creating healthy and sustainable open source communities is the guiding principle behind our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source investments. By sponsoring OSTIF and OpenSSF, we are helping to ensure the long-term security and viability of critical open source software projects that will benefit our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customers, AWS, and the entire information technology ecosystem..&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is thrilled to announce its first philanthropic partnership with <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a> (ON). OSTIF is joining a strong network of open source advocates and specialists under the ON portfolio to further the Open and Secure Internet Ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>“This is a significant accomplishment for OSTIF and expands our network with tech philanthropy. Omidyar Network’s support will augment our commitment to a strong and secure open source ecosystem”</em> said Amir Montazery, Managing Director of OSTIF.</p>
<p>While OSTIFs primary focus is helping projects improve security posture through audits, supply chain review, building security tools, and providing fixes, this partnership focuses on fundraising and messaging. Improving OSTIFs messaging and extending reach will help the organization gain new partnerships and magnify our impact. This positive feedback loop will continue to help OSTIF grow and add services to our already comprehensive work.</p>
<p>This partnership comes at a perfect time for OSTIF, as the organization is releasing Impact Reports from its current partnerships (see: <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/08/08/improving-cncf-security-posture-with-independent-security-audits/">CNCF Impact Report</a> post) and fundraising for 2023. With over 150 security vulnerabilities found and fixed, including 10 critical severity and 25 high severity fixes in the first half of 2022 alone, OSTIF is growing its impact on improving the security of the open source ecosystem. Recent fixes include Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DOS), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in tech stacks used in a majority of global cloud vendors and their clients. For OSTIF, more funding means more security audits, more vulnerability fixes, and greater improvement to open source projects.</p>
<p>A big thank you to Govind Shivkumar of Omidyar Network, Michael Brennan from the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/">Ford Foundation</a>, and Kim Lewandowski of <a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/">Chainguard</a> for all their help and support in getting this partnership off the ground.</p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duckduckgo</a>, the privacy search engine, has contributed to OSTIF for a second time by donating $25,000 USD. Their site that tracks their charitable donations <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/2021-duckduckgo-donations/">Spread Privacy</a> has the official announcement.</p>
<p>These funds are not allocated to any specific project, which helps OSTIF tremendously by allowing us to spend resources on overhead costs of doing business that the organization needs to spend money on to function. Most of our funding from corporate donors comes with specific projects in mind and doesn&#8217;t significantly help the core organization function.</p>
<p>Duckduckgo originally donated to OSTIF for <a href="https://ostif.org/the-veracrypt-audit-results/">our first project, VeraCrypt</a>, which helped prove that our concept worked and ultimately led to where we are today, nearly six years later. Their continued support shows their commitment to keeping the open source projects we rely on secure.</p>
<p>And a special thank you to Katie and Charlie for helping to make this happen!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is working with the Monero community to fund at least two (and probably three) audits of Monero RandomX.</p>
<h2>What is RandomX?</h2>
<p>RandomX is a project that implements a dynamic proof of work algorithm. The aim of an algorithm that changes is to make it difficult to design efficient circuitry that can fully automate the algorithm in an ASIC. The increased complexity of the algorithm makes it so that an ASIC would lose the advantages that it has over more traditional CPU/GPU designs that can execute many types of code and do many types of mathematics.</p>
<p>The goal of RandomX is to be a significant boost to ASIC resistance, which is seen as a hedge against centralization.</p>
<p>Monero (and some other cryptocurrencies) are fighting to overcome significant efforts to centralize mining under ASICs, because one of the fundamental components of cryptocurrency is that access to mining needs to be egalitarian, and custom ASIC designs place the lions&#8217; share of the processing power under the control of a few centralized entities, who then gain significant control over the blockchain.</p>
<p>The community has selected three auditors, and a fourth, <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a>, is also looking at the code through an independent group <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave.org</a>.</p>
<p>The auditors are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/">Kudelski Security</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41 D-Sec</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/en/">QuarksLab</a></p>
<p>You can read the actual proposals from each team here: <a href="https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits">https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits</a></p>
<p>The fundraising has been moving quickly, if you have some XMR that you&#8217;d like to contribute to the effort <a href="https://ccs.getmonero.org/projects/14/donate">you can pitch in here</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We have just completed our review of <a href="https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/">OpenSSL 1.1.1 with QuarksLab</a>, and we are moving on to our next big project, Unbound DNS!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />What is Unbound and Why is it Important?</h2>



<p>One of the core functions of the internet is domain name resolution. This means that when you type in a domain name like &#8220;ostif.org&#8221; into your browser, your computer asks a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name Server</a> (DNS Server) where OSTIF.org is, and that server returns an address to your browser so that it knows where to go to load the site. This same system is used in apps, operating systems, and every web-connected service.</p>



<p>The entire DNS system is decades old and was not originally designed with security or privacy in mind. This means that DNS was designed as &#8220;connectionless&#8221; and without encryption. This opens up DNS to all kinds of problem like <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/dns-reflection-attack/">DNS reflection attacks</a> (hijacking many DNS servers to knock down websites via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing">DNS Spoofing and DNS Poisoning</a> (an attacker intercepting your DNS requests and sending back malicious IP addresses), and wholesale surveillance (all DNS requests going through multiple parties on the web who can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_analytics">record every website you visit and every service you use</a>).</p>



<p>To fix this, standards have been developed to make DNS more trustworthy by encrypting the connections and verifying the data coming back from the servers is not from an interloper. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DNS over TLS</a> are the two major solutions used today.</p>



<p>The most popular open-source solution out there is <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> by <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/">NLNetLabs</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To help increase online privacy, Unbound supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858">DNS-over-TLS</a> which allows clients to encrypt their communication. In addition, it supports various modern standards that limit the amount of data exchanged with authoritative servers. These standards do not only improve privacy but also help making the DNS more robust. The most important are <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7816">Query Name Minimisation</a>, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8198">Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache</a> and support for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7706">authority zones</a>, which can be used to load a copy of the root zone.</p>
<cite>https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about</cite></blockquote>



<p>Not only is it widely used in many sites and services, but it is integrated into projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> that are increasing the security of the entire Internet through enabling widespread use of free security certificates for Domain Names. Let&#8217;s Encrypt serves over 150 million domain certificates that enable https on websites around the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Are We Collaborating?</h2>



<p>OSTIF and Unbound have been discussing their current security practices and potential improvements, as well as establishing secure communications with NLNetLabs for reporting issues. Now, we are raising money for a full security review of Unbound, which will be conducted with <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41-Dsec in Germany</a>. After all issues are resolved we will publish the audit report for the public to review, and then Unbound will join our bug-bounty program to bring white-hat hackers around the world in to do continuous review of the code and locate further issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much do we need to raise?</h2>



<p>We need to raise approximately <strong>$139,000</strong> in total to cover the cost of the audit, the pool of money for the bug bounty system, and various operations costs (transaction fees on donations, etc). These numbers come from the size of the code base, the complexity of the code, the quality of the documentation on how the app works, and the current security practices which influence the scope of the audit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW TO GET INVOLVED!</h2>



<p>You can donate to us through a huge number of easy options <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/">here</a>. Recurring donations through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=-Lm4ufIoIVeBypaM9HgKtQOGXhNDuJbgMacyGeP-zT8KFI9pmdsOKu2Q50CtJDt5DbYQN0&amp;country.x=US&amp;locale.x=US">Paypal</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OSTIF">Patreon</a> help us more than one-time commitments, as recurring funding allows us to better budget and plan our finances. Every little bit helps. The community effect adds up to help us cover all of our operations costs and tech expenses!</p>



<p>More importantly, you can help spread the word about our work. These projects only succeed because people hear about us and get involved. We have an active twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/ostifofficial?lang=en">@ostifofficial</a> and we are frequently on Reddit as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ostifofficial">/u/ostifofficial</a>. Tell people about our project and that we are making the Internet a safer place for all of us.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you work for a company that utilizes open-source software like OpenVPN, OpenSSL, Unbound, Open Office, BitMessage, VeraCrypt, MariaDB or VLC Media Player, PHP, Apache, DD-WRT, or GnuPG GPA, encourage them to get involved in the effort. We have various support tiers that companies can join to both help us make the internet more secure while simultaneously improving their own security. Companies that get involved also get a direct line to our managers to help us select future projects and direct the organization through our advisory counsel and steering committees.</p>



<p>We are excited to bring Unbound onto OSTIF support! Let&#8217;s get this done!</p>

<h2>What are we working on?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a></span> powers everything. 70% of the top million websites use OpenSSL to provide encryption services to their visitors and to encrypt user information. It&#8217;s in thousands of apps, and the internet as we know it relies on OpenSSL to protect our information.</p>
<p>The NSA has tried to compromise OpenSSL before, by<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/01/14/hopefully-last-post-ill-ever-write-on/">introducing weakened standards</a> </span>and<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-rsa/exclusive-secret-contract-tied-nsa-and-security-industry-pioneer-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220">bribing companies to use those weakened components</a></span>.</p>
<p>OpenSSL is getting a major update with version 1.1.1, called<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.eweek.com/security/tls-1.3-encryption-standard-moves-forward-improving-internet-security">TLS 1.3</a>.</span> It is a new set of security standards and cryptography for the next generation of encryption. There&#8217;s a lot of new code, new options, and new features.</p>
<p>We need to publicly review this code to make sure that it is as safe as possible. Specific areas that the NSA has attacked before (the Pseudorandom Number Generator or PRNG) are getting big updates and need to be independently verified.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want another compromised PRNG, Heartbleed, Logjam, FREAK, or CCS Injection problem to slip through the cracks. We need to ensure that OpenSSL is safe for all of us to use long into the future.</p>
<p>For more technical details on the scope of the audit, look here: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/">https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/</a></span></p>
<p><strong>These projects do not happen without your support. Tell your friends. Spread the word. Donate. We need to build a safer internet together.</strong></p>

<p>Today, we begin our second round of funding in partnership with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, who will be matching Crowdrise donations for the next four weeks!</p>
<p>You can view the Crowdrise campaign and donate here to have your donation matched (doubled): <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/">https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/</a></p>
<h2>OpenSSL 1.1.1 Project Changes</h2>
<p>We have made changes to the proposed OpenSSL project to bring down costs while still allocating enough resources to ensure that a complete and thorough audit is completed.</p>
<p>The original plan was for all OpenSSL components in the scope to be reviewed by two separate teams, one at Kudelski and one at QuarksLab. This was costly and redundant work that greatly inflated the cost of the project and has delayed fundraising and completion.</p>
<p>To trim down costs, we have:</p>
<p>-Removed Kudelski as our secondary auditor (they were the higher of the two bids).</p>
<p>-Added Jean-Phillipe Aumasson specifically to review the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) changes.</p>
<p>-Removed overhead costs such as t-shirts and other giveaways that greatly inflate the costs of the fundraising.</p>
<p>These changes reduced our overall cost of the project substantially and our project fundraising goal is <strong>LESS THAN HALF</strong> of what it was originally.</p>
<p>We now only need to raise a total of $150,000 to meet our goal and fully fund the project. We are already over halfway there!</p>
<p>The goal on CrowdRise ($70000) represents the funds that we need to raise to complete the OpenSSL project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>November 19th OpenSSL Fundraiser Updates &#8211; Progress and Thank Yous</h1>
<p>Our work fundraising for the massive <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/">OpenSSL 1.1.1 project continues</a></span>. Our project is now up to hundreds of backers and dozens of companies and organizations.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://openvpn.net">OpenVPN Technologies</a> for their continued support (they have donated an additonal $5000), and our new big supporters Shawn C (AKA &#8220;citypw&#8221; of the <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hardenedlinux.github.io/">Hardened Linux project</a>) and two anonymous donors that made significant contributions. We&#8217;ve also had many small donations from the wider community.</p>
<p>This places the project at 40% funded, and we will continuously work until the money is raised and the project can be completed.</p>
<p>Your involvement is crucial in the success of this project and OSTIF as a whole. We need our supporters to make as much noise as possible to make the community aware of this project and what we are trying to accomplish. If you are a customer of a company that utilizes OpenSSL (hint: almost all of them do) send them a message about their opportunity to contribute to making the web safer for all of us! The more businesses and individuals we get in our coalition, the more we can accomplish and the faster we can get things done.</p>
<p>If you want to support this crucial project, be sure to <a href="https://ostif.org/donate"><span style="color: #0000ff;">donate here</span></a> and share our message to everyone you possibly can!</p>
<p>We are making the web safer for all of us. <strong>Keep pushing!</strong></p>
