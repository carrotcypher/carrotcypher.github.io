										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Eclipse Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">’s </span><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/equinox/p2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Equinox P2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> was audited by </span><a href="https://includesecurity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Include Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in November 2022. Equinox P2 is a provisioning platform, started by IBM in 2001. The Eclipse Foundation was founded three years later to act as an open, non-for-profit leader of the Eclipse Project community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF was contacted by the Foundation, with </span><a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2022/06/20/openssf-funds-python-and-eclipse-foundations-and-acquires-sos-dev-through-alpha-omega-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400">funding from OpenSSF project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, to perform a security audit and provide recommendations for security hardening. With Include Security, the audit resulted in a developed threat model, code review, and analysis of SAST and fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Include Security team followed a static code analysis with white-box code review methodology throughout the engagement. The result was one critical, three medium, and five low-risk findings. For the threat model, the focal point was on feasibly applicable threat actors to PGP-based signature verification. Everything else was considered out of the scope of the audit. In a methodical practice, Include created a threat model of the Target of Evaluation after a four step system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the 22 person days spent on the audit, Include Security also worked on SAST tooling and fuzzing for continuous monitoring. In the report, Include Security offers three security tools and recommendations of how fuzzing and SAST tooling could be reworked to best run on P2’s code. This would be mainly by adding rules to scanners to eliminate noise and false positives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF would like to extend our gratitude to the Equinox P2 team and the Eclipse Foundation for their participation and partnership in this security audit, particularly Mikael Barbero and Marta Rybczynska. Thank you as well to those at Include Security, for their hard work and final report on this project. Finally, we would like to acknowledge and thank OpenSSF </span><a href="https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for their financial support of this critical security work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited to report the results for the security audit of </span><a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sigstore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Sigstore is a new standard for signing, verifying and protecting software; and has quickly grown into a premier tool for securing the software supply chain. The security review was facilitated by Open Source Technology Improvement Fund and carried out by </span><a href="https://includesecurity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. The sigstore team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by requesting independent review and actively participating in the audit process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the security audit are three findings (1 High Risk, 2 Low Risk), fuzzing improvements, and a documented threat model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-risk finding along with one of the low-risk findings identified through this security audit has been fixed and validated. See below for the full report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big thank you to the </span><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://openssf.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenSSF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for supporting the work and to the </span><a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sigstore project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for funding the audit. Furthermore, thank you to the Include Security team for executing the audit and working with us to make and validate fixes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also special thanks to Bob Calloway, Brian Behlendorf, David A. Wheeler, Dan Lorenc, and Luke Hinds for their role in the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Everyone around the world depends on OSS, and we would love to do more security audits!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited to report the results of a security audit of </span><a href="https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slf4j</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Simple Logging Facade for Java, slf4j, is identified in the </span><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/tools/census-ii-of-free-and-open-source-software-application-libraries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Census II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results as one of the most widely-deployed logging frameworks. The security and supply chain review was facilitated by </span><a href="https://ostif.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and carried out by </span><a href="https://includesecurity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. Upon review, it was found that slf4j has a very small attack surface area and does not support post-processing of logging messages that may be cause for security concern, such as the </span><a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">log4j vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the security audit are three (1 Low Risk, 2 Informational) findings, a documented threat model, and a Supply Chain Security review against SLSA. As a result of this review, slf4j, logback, and reload4j (a new fork of log4j 1.x with security fixes) are now reproducible builds, which substantially increases the difficulty of a supply-chain attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All findings identified through this security audit have been fixed and validated. See below for the full report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge thank you to Ceki Gülcü of slf4j for actively participating in the audit process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to </span><a href="https://openssf.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenSSF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for supporting the work and to Google for funding the audit. </span></p>
