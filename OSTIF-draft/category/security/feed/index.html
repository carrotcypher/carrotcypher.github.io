										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications, worked with OSTIF and </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to help improve the project’s security posture. The multi-phased engagement, sponsored by Google, focused first on the triaging and closing of bugs, then upon further improving the core fuzzers that continually monitor for security issues using OSS-Fuzz infrastructure at </span><a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz."><span style="font-weight: 400">https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> This engagement is part of a series of security efforts to improve the security and reliability of Envoy. Earlier efforts include the </span><a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_envoy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">2018 Audit of Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by </span><a href="https://cure53.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cure53</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ada Logics</span></a> <a href="https://blog.envoyproxy.io/a-stroll-down-fuzzer-optimisation-lane-and-why-instrumentation-policies-matter-f0012ec260b3"><span style="font-weight: 400">fuzzing infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> work</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase I of the engagement was designed to help the Envoy Team reduce the number of open bugs identified, reduce noise in the existing fuzzers (so the Envoy team spends less time triaging non-issues), and improve fuzzing coverage where possible. OSTIF sourced four senior security experts from X41 D-sec to complete the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result of Phase I was the fixing of 68 security bugs. Furthermore, two critical vulnerabilities were found and proactively fixed. At the beginning of the Phase I engagement, there were 76 Total Fuzz Issues. As fixes and improvements were implemented, new fuzz issues were identified for analysis, allowing for further iteration and fine-tuning. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <strong>Figure 1: Total Fuzz Issues vs Fixed at end of Phase I </strong></span><strong>(Sept, 2022)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase II was focused on improving the number of executions/second and high signal to noise ratio produced by the fuzzers. Additionally to triaging remaining open high priority fuzzers from Phase I, there was an effort to close another 10 health check related fuzz issues. In order to cover more code faster, while remaining highly efficient and controlling output, X41 was able to analyze bugs from the first phase to determine how the fuzzers were running tests and where they were losing speed and validity. Of Envoy’s original 67 fuzzers, 19 were considered high priority due </span><span style="font-weight: 400">to testing code paths that are exposed to potential attack vectors; by dataplane traffic in the form of QoDs and bugs that can impact reliability and security of Envoy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Because Envoy is also offered as a service, fuzz testing and hardening the configuration interface is crucial.  When fuzzers work on data and configurations simultaneously, there can be a tendency for them to move away from configurations that need deeper testing. This results in less code coverage. Envoy’s code base uses debug assertions, which further slowed down the testing process and often returned noise. To combat and remediate these multiple consequences, X41’s team developed a plan. First, create a way to generate valid configuration files by introspecting the configuration description already augmented by expressions supplying context, and then develop a two-step fuzzing process with the configuration files generated then used for fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The team of Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild and Dr. Robert Femmer had to develop a way to address the set of points they identified as limiting the fuzzers functionality. They aimed to improve the critical fuzzers that run on HTTP decoders and stream management, specifically HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and the HTTP/3 codec interfaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Vehreschild and Dr. Femmer not only developed four new fuzzers, but improved the overall security testing environment of Envoy instrumentally. The created fuzzers targeted HTTP decoders for high throughput focused on primary attack surfaces of Http1 (Balsa and http_parser), Http2 (nghttp2 and oghttp2), and Http3 Quic. To address the issues around configuration files, the team experimented with running configurations repeatedly to explore the data plane deeper before generating another configuration. Configurations found could increase fuzzing speed by a factor of 4 to 20 times. Further work resulted in removing debug assertions and reducing the binary size of fuzzers by a factor of 1.5. By developing ways to create valid and long-running configurations across the configuration and data planes, the performance of fuzzers was increased by a factor of 40. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The graph below strongly suggests that, since </span>March 2022<span style="font-weight: 400"> when Phase I of the engagement began, there has been a downward trend in generation of new fuzz issues due to this collective effort. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work took months to complete and was an open discussion-based project that allowed for all members to collaborate, help each other, and discuss the possibilities and testing done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We sincerely thank Kirtimaan Rajshiva, Adi Peleg, Yan Avlasov, Harvey Tuch, Joshua Marantz, and the entire Envoy Platform Team for funding and guiding this effort along with Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild, Dr. Robert Femmer, and Sofie Seuren of X41 D-Sec for their diligent work and insight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate and improve security posture for the betterment of FOSS. We would also like to recognize Google, without whose funding this project would not have been possible.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.crossplane.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Crossplane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> underwent a successful third party security audit by </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the support of Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF). Used by firms such as JP Morgan, Time Warner, and MIT Lincoln Lab, the project is considered Incubating at </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/crossplane/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Over the first half of 2023, the multi-cloud control plane for Kubernetes API was examined, reviewed, and tested before its v 1.13 release with fixes from this audit. With the ultimate goal of graduation in mind, the audit team had its work cut out for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A holistic, comprehensive audit of Core Crossplane and Crossplane Runtime repositories was performed by manual code auditing, a fuzzing suite review, the creation of a threat model, and a </span><a href="https://slsa.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400">SLSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> grade. As the threat model was built, the audit team was able to determine attack surfaces and pinch points to focus upon which directed the manual code review. For example, supply chain security issues that Crossplane experiences as an image and package manager exposes the project to the potential for threat actors to introduce supply chain attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fuzzing being performed in Crossplane (by thirteen fuzzers ADA Logics </span><a href="https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/security/ADA-fuzzing-audit-22.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">previously created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for the project!) is critical to the ongoing, continuous monitoring of the security, health, and environment of the code. An additional four fuzzers were added during this audit with an additional fuzzer improved by way of increased code coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of the sixteen issues identified during the audit, fifteen were resolved by the Crossplane. This includes two CVEs that were found during the audit. First, a high severity finding that could allow image tampering was issued as CVE-2023-38495, and second, a low severity Denial-of-Service finding labeled CVE-2023-37900. In summation, 7 low, 8 medium, and 1 high finding were reported. The singular unfixed issue is located in the alpha features of Crossplane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are so grateful to the Crossplane team for their contributions, fixes, and investment in this audit’s execution. Further thanks to ADA Logics for their report and hard work on this project with us. It’s always a pleasure to collaborate with you. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to CNCF for their financial support of this audit and ongoing open source security work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF), </span><a href="https://k9mail.app/"><span style="font-weight: 400">K-9 Mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://7asecurity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">7ASecurity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> collaborated on a security audit of the Mozilla K-9 email application. K-9 is an open source email application and runs on most Android phone systems. Ideally, the application is reliable, intuitive, and secure to use. Not only critical to Android products, K-9 mail is popular as a project on Github and with non-contributing users. Many people therefore have a vested interest in the security health of this application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The assigned team of six auditors used whitebox methods for this audit. The scope of the audit consisted of multiple aspects including threat modeling, fuzzing, and supply chain analysis. A thorough review to identify, test, and remediate as many security issues as possible within scope was 7ASecurity’s stated goal. They combed through the code, and adjusted focus as the project led them. The final report linked below includes details of the work; such as implementing ossfuzz fuzzers along with semgrep and CodeQL rules, as well as how the team responded to the updated SLSA framework released during the 46 person day engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncovered during the security audit were seven medium and three low risk vulnerabilities, along with nine miscellaneous hardening recommendations. Of the 19 total issues, the K-9 Mail team fixed nine and partially resolved two more. By following the recommendations of the report, K-9 Mail can grow its security posture as it begins to become Thunderbird for Android. It has an incredible foundation to begin this new chapter with, as the report notes seven wide-ranging points of secure and healthy practices and conditions of K-9 Mail they saw evidenced during the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The K-9 team did an exceptional job communicating and sharing information that allowed 7ASecurity to perform as comprehensive an audit as possible. Our gratitude to Christian Ketterer, Lisa McCormack, Ryan Sipes, Wolf-Martell Montwé and the rest of the K-9 Mail team. And to 7ASecurity, particularly Abraham Aranguren, Dariusz Jastrzębski, Daniel Ortiz, Dr. Miroslav Štampar, Óscar Martínez, and Patrick Ventuzelo- thank you for your hard work. We are thankful as well to our sponsor, </span><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mozilla</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, for their support of K-9’s current and future security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;OSTIF has a strong understanding of how open source projects operate and we really appreciated that they were able to jump in and help us coordinate an audit of the K-9 Mail software. OSTIF were great partners that made the process of doing the audit a breeze and provided a helpful guiding hand. We really appreciated their professionalism and expertise. I can confidently say that we plan on working with OSTIF again. &#8220;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the Spring of 2023, OSTIF, </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://notaryproject.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Notary Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> collaborated on a security audit of the new Notation libraries. </span><a href="https://github.com/notaryproject/notation"><span style="font-weight: 400">Notation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a CLI project to add signatures as standard items in the registry ecosystem and to build a set of simple tooling for signing and verifying signatures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven issues were found by the audit team and remediated by the Notary Project team. A single high vulnerability identified during the engagement allowed unverified descriptors to be fetched from a remote registry. This was classified as </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33959"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33959</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Such an action could allow a malicious actor to sign or verify an artifact that could fool a user into using a malicious artifact. A solution was devised by using the library to validate descriptors as being provided by the user. Three issues (two medium and one low) were related to signature processing, using endless data attacks to cause resource exhaustion that could lead to denial of service. See </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33957"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33957</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33958"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33958</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for more details. The fix for these scenarios was uncomplicated, and can even be modified by users should it be necessary for their use of the library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The CVEs linked above were issued for three of the seven findings, and the other four received documentation to track them or CLI command flag name changes. These resolutions are in place in subsequent releases including RC-7 and 1.0.0 of Notary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Notary Project team was eager and reactive to solving reported issues, and as a result their development and release processes were tested and improved. Thank you particularly to Feynman Zhou, Junjie Gao, Pritesh Bandi, Patrick Zheng, Samir Kakkar, Shiwei Zhang, Toddy Mladenov, Vani Rao, and Yi Zha for their involvement in this audit. ADA Logics created and imparted wonderful work with this audit and report, and we are thankful to them for their part. Finally, OSTIF would like to offer our gratitude to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for their financial support of work like this and other efforts that improve open source security. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) is thrilled to announce the results of security improvements via improved fuzzing capabilities on the </span><a href="https://liblouis.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Liblouis project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by ADA Logics! Liblouis is a braille translator with expansive capabilities that runs on open source code. In 2021, the project onboarded to OSS-Fuzz to perform ongoing security testing, but the code coverage was initially low. OSTIF and ADA Logics saw an opportunity to improve a project centered around accessibility, and armed with the knowledge and ability to contribute impactful security work to Liblouis, the project moved ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">David and Adam Korczynski of </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> contributed two fuzzers and a fuzzing dictionary to the project. First of the two fuzzers addressed the input translation, and this fuzzers ability to work across diverse input is pivotal. The second fuzzer acts similarly to the first, just that it executes back translation instead of the forward translation of the other fuzzer. The dictionary, which is for both new fuzzers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">captures all of the Opcode names used for translation table construction. Just the introduction of this dictionary caused a 45% increase in code coverage the day it was implemented. In total, code coverage went from around 20% to just below 80%; with static reachability peaking at 93%, an increase of 16% from the start of engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The data, found via the ADA Logics link below, was generated and analyzed using the Introspector, an insightful tool for visualizing OSS Fuzz setups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six issues were found by these fuzzers due to improved performance and code coverage. ADA Logics expects more to come as the fuzzers continuously run, providing hardened security outcomes to protect the users of Liblouis. David and Adam included further testing area recommendations in their work for maintainers to continue improving security measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work was organized, researched, and completed not for compensation, but out of love of the community and in fulfilling a mission to improve security posture for open source projects. Open source is maintained for all, and support can and should be rendered for programs that promote inclusivity and access for all.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is proud to announce the publication of our fourteenth completed audit this year! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In association with </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://theupdateframework.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">go-tuf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OSTIF publishes another FOSS security audit after weeks of hard work and dedication. Go-tuf is used to securely run software update systems in Go as part of </span><a href="https://theupdateframework.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Update Framework</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (“TUF”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main priority of the audit was to review go-tuf’s source code, primarily completed by manual review. Fuzzers were mainly used for preliminary scoping of the source code. It is hypothesized by the X41 team that while it is possible to perform fuzz testing deeper in go-tuf, fuzzing efforts are best focused at detecting irregularities in implementations. During the process of code review performed by X41, one medium, one low, and four unranked vulnerabilities were identified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The medium criticality with two confirmed attack scenarios was classified as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 59, Improper Link Resolution Before File Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which could allow a bad actor to place their own links into the repository. The low severity criticality was architectural, dealing with possible untied updates or metadata. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is grateful to our frequent collaborators, X41 D-sec, for their work and report on go-tuf. Furthermore, we express our gratitude toward the go-tuf team, particularly Joshua Lock and Radoslav Dimitrov. Thank you as well to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their funding and support of this audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback from go-tuf: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the go-tuf community we were happy to see the results of the assessment and the overall quality of the report.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the completion of this audit and more, we hope to encourage further collaboration and successes in the FOSS security space.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is Vital for Vitess!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, in collaboration with </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ada Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is proud to announce the results of a successful</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">security audit for </span><a href="https://vitess.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitess</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Born at Youtube in 2010 to help scale up database interactions, Vitess eventually moved under the umbrella of </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Native Computing Foundation,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graduating at CNCF in 2019. Used in over 50 projects, Vitess’s functions of scaling, workflow, and shard management are critical for growing applications that see thousands, sometimes millions, of users daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VTAdmin is a new aspect of Vitess, and as such the whole of the component was considered during this audit as an artifact for security review. During this audit Ada Logics ran with a five point list of goals, including manual code review, a threat model, improving Vitess’s fuzzing suite, and a </span><a href="http://slsa.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grade.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the moderate vulnerabilities that were reported, two CVEs had the potential to allow malicious users to block other users from using the full capabilities of VTAdmin or Vitess. For example, stopping others from creating shards. Two of the fuzzers created by Ada Logics for Vitess were directly inspired by these two CVEs, and were immediately implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Described further in the report are details of VTAdmin’s attack surface, SLSA compliance, and all 12 vulnerabilities disclosed during the process of the audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF extends its deep gratitude to Deepthi Sigireddi and the entire Vitess Maintainer team as well as David Korczyzski and Adam Korczynski of Ada Logics.  Further thanks to CNCF for their gracious funding of this audit and continued work in open source security.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In collaboration with </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://in-toto.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-toto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OSTIF is pleased to announce the publication of our audit of in-toto’s source code. In-toto, which has implementations in Python and Go, is a framework software for supply chain security. Integrating security and transparency through the entire process of application, in-toto’s holistic view of supply chain security is admired by us at OSTIF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using manual review (aided with differing static code analyzers for the respective code languages), X41 D-sec team identified 1 High, 4 Medium, and 3 Low severity vulnerabilities. In-toto’s source code is foundationally strong, and reviewed all in-scope code in the designated audit period. Furthermore, X41’s team took measures to help improve the overall security posture of in-toto’s code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the eight vulnerabilities, the most critical could compromise the security chain all the way to final verification. In the Python implementation, multiple vulnerabilities were associated with data verification signed with PGP keys in the layout file imported from GnuPG. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We extend our gratitude to the in-toto team, CNCF for their funding and support of this audit, and especially X-41DSec for their dedication and hard work on this audit. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF,</span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://c-ares.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c-ares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coordinated on a security audit of c-ares’s source code in spring of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C-ares is a library written in C for asynchronous DNS requests, which runs on such applications as Microsoft Windows, Netware, and Android. It was developed at MIT, when a group expanded upon the capabilities of the ares library and licensed c-ares in 1998. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This audit was a well ordered and educational experience for the OSTIF team. While we hope this report will reach those who are able to best benefit from documented FOSS security audits, we know that the work itself will reach all those who depend on c-ares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, X41 found the c-ares library to be well designed and implemented. The audit found six inconsistencies during the process. Three vulnerabilities were rated as medium, three others as informational. Alongside performing static manual code review, the X41 team implemented and customized AFL++ fuzzers during this audit. Recently, AFL++ fuzzers have been made to support command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing, which was important to this audit as c-ares is made up of multiple CLI tooling components in its code base. While the audit particularly focused on memory corruption vulnerabilities which are common in C libraries, two of the medium vulnerabilities were categorized as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 330</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Use of Insufficiently Random Values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so grateful to the c-ares team, particularly their </span><a href="https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/releases"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine contributors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as X41’s fantastic staff for their efforts on this project. </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored this work and we are deeply appreciative of their support of open source security.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Generally speaking, OSTIF as well as the maintainers of the library deserve a lot of praise for their overall support and assistance. It was a pleasure for the testing team working with them.”</strong></span></p>
<p>-from the X41 Team on c-ares</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s our privilege to announce that OSTIF’s sixth security audit of 2023 is with l</span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libcap/libcap.git/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ibcap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! This was only possible with the fantastic work of </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and generous support of </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libcap is a library for getting and setting POSIX.1e draft 15 capabilities. The 26 year old project is maintained by Andrew G Morgan, a dedicated FOSS community member who was a joy to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identified in the process of this audit were 2 vulnerabilities, one medium (CVE-2023-2603) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and one low (CVE-2023-2602) severity, which guided the customization of multiple fuzz test harnesses for the project. X41 found that the libcap library necessitated the use of AFL++ fuzzing due to the memory corruption vulnerabilities commonly found in C. This was performed in coordination with ASAN (address space sanitizers). The found low severity vulnerability was in fact memory leak related, and the medium had to do with integer overflow on 32bit systems with a specific byte size. These were both addressed before publication of this blog. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would very much like to thank the OSTIF and X41 D-Sec for organizing and completing a thorough and timely audit of the libcap project code. The written audit report is well structured, clear and insightful and I&#8217;m happy that libcap-2.69 has addressed the issues it has uncovered.”  -Andrew G. Morgan</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF would like to thank X41 D-sec for their hard work and perpetual dedication to FOSS security. Their <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/news/2023/05/15/libcap-source-code-audit/">blog can be found here</a> with further details of this project. We extend our gratitude to Amazon Web Services for their sponsorship of this audit and by extension, important security work being performed in open source. </span></p>
