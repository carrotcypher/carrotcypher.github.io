Earlier efforts include the </span><a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_envoy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">2018 Audit of Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by </span><a href="https://cure53.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cure53</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ada Logics</span></a> <a href="https://blog.envoyproxy.io/a-stroll-down-fuzzer-optimisation-lane-and-why-instrumentation-policies-matter-f0012ec260b3"><span style="font-weight: 400">fuzzing infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> work</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase I of the engagement was designed to help the Envoy Team reduce the number of open bugs identified, reduce noise in the existing fuzzers (so the Envoy team spends less time triaging non-issues), and improve fuzzing coverage where possible. OSTIF sourced four senior security experts from X41 D-sec to complete the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result of Phase I was the fixing of 68 security bugs. Furthermore, two critical vulnerabilities were found and proactively fixed. At the beginning of the Phase I engagement, there were 76 Total Fuzz Issues. As fixes and improvements were implemented, new fuzz issues were identified for analysis, allowing for further iteration and fine-tuning. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <strong>Figure 1: Total Fuzz Issues vs Fixed at end of Phase I </strong></span><strong>(Sept, 2022)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase II was focused on improving the number of executions/second and high signal to noise ratio produced by the fuzzers. Additionally to triaging remaining open high priority fuzzers from Phase I, there was an effort to close another 10 health check related fuzz issues. In order to cover more code faster, while remaining highly efficient and controlling output, X41 was able to analyze bugs from the first phase to determine how the fuzzers were running tests and where they were losing speed and validity. Of Envoy’s original 67 fuzzers, 19 were considered high priority due </span><span style="font-weight: 400">to testing code paths that are exposed to potential attack vectors; by dataplane traffic in the form of QoDs and bugs that can impact reliability and security of Envoy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Because Envoy is also offered as a service, fuzz testing and hardening the configuration interface is crucial.  When fuzzers work on data and configurations simultaneously, there can be a tendency for them to move away from configurations that need deeper testing. This results in less code coverage. Envoy’s code base uses debug assertions, which further slowed down the testing process and often returned noise. To combat and remediate these multiple consequences, X41’s team developed a plan. First, create a way to generate valid configuration files by introspecting the configuration description already augmented by expressions supplying context, and then develop a two-step fuzzing process with the configuration files generated then used for fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The team of Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild and Dr. Robert Femmer had to develop a way to address the set of points they identified as limiting the fuzzers functionality. They aimed to improve the critical fuzzers that run on HTTP decoders and stream management, specifically HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and the HTTP/3 codec interfaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Vehreschild and Dr. Femmer not only developed four new fuzzers, but improved the overall security testing environment of Envoy instrumentally. The created fuzzers targeted HTTP decoders for high throughput focused on primary attack surfaces of Http1 (Balsa and http_parser), Http2 (nghttp2 and oghttp2), and Http3 Quic. To address the issues around configuration files, the team experimented with running configurations repeatedly to explore the data plane deeper before generating another configuration. Configurations found could increase fuzzing speed by a factor of 4 to 20 times. Further work resulted in removing debug assertions and reducing the binary size of fuzzers by a factor of 1.5. By developing ways to create valid and long-running configurations across the configuration and data planes, the performance of fuzzers was increased by a factor of 40. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The graph below strongly suggests that, since </span>March 2022<span style="font-weight: 400"> when Phase I of the engagement began, there has been a downward trend in generation of new fuzz issues due to this collective effort. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work took months to complete and was an open discussion-based project that allowed for all members to collaborate, help each other, and discuss the possibilities and testing done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We sincerely thank Kirtimaan Rajshiva, Adi Peleg, Yan Avlasov, Harvey Tuch, Joshua Marantz, and the entire Envoy Platform Team for funding and guiding this effort along with Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild, Dr. Robert Femmer, and Sofie Seuren of X41 D-Sec for their diligent work and insight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate and improve security posture for the betterment of FOSS. We would also like to recognize Google, without whose funding this project would not have been possible.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is proud to announce the publication of our fourteenth completed audit this year! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In association with </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://theupdateframework.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">go-tuf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OSTIF publishes another FOSS security audit after weeks of hard work and dedication. Go-tuf is used to securely run software update systems in Go as part of </span><a href="https://theupdateframework.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Update Framework</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (“TUF”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main priority of the audit was to review go-tuf’s source code, primarily completed by manual review. Fuzzers were mainly used for preliminary scoping of the source code. It is hypothesized by the X41 team that while it is possible to perform fuzz testing deeper in go-tuf, fuzzing efforts are best focused at detecting irregularities in implementations. During the process of code review performed by X41, one medium, one low, and four unranked vulnerabilities were identified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The medium criticality with two confirmed attack scenarios was classified as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 59, Improper Link Resolution Before File Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which could allow a bad actor to place their own links into the repository. The low severity criticality was architectural, dealing with possible untied updates or metadata. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is grateful to our frequent collaborators, X41 D-sec, for their work and report on go-tuf. Furthermore, we express our gratitude toward the go-tuf team, particularly Joshua Lock and Radoslav Dimitrov. Thank you as well to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their funding and support of this audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback from go-tuf: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the go-tuf community we were happy to see the results of the assessment and the overall quality of the report.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the completion of this audit and more, we hope to encourage further collaboration and successes in the FOSS security space.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In collaboration with </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://in-toto.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-toto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OSTIF is pleased to announce the publication of our audit of in-toto’s source code. In-toto, which has implementations in Python and Go, is a framework software for supply chain security. Integrating security and transparency through the entire process of application, in-toto’s holistic view of supply chain security is admired by us at OSTIF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using manual review (aided with differing static code analyzers for the respective code languages), X41 D-sec team identified 1 High, 4 Medium, and 3 Low severity vulnerabilities. In-toto’s source code is foundationally strong, and reviewed all in-scope code in the designated audit period. Furthermore, X41’s team took measures to help improve the overall security posture of in-toto’s code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the eight vulnerabilities, the most critical could compromise the security chain all the way to final verification. In the Python implementation, multiple vulnerabilities were associated with data verification signed with PGP keys in the layout file imported from GnuPG. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We extend our gratitude to the in-toto team, CNCF for their funding and support of this audit, and especially X-41DSec for their dedication and hard work on this audit. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF,</span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://c-ares.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c-ares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coordinated on a security audit of c-ares’s source code in spring of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C-ares is a library written in C for asynchronous DNS requests, which runs on such applications as Microsoft Windows, Netware, and Android. It was developed at MIT, when a group expanded upon the capabilities of the ares library and licensed c-ares in 1998. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This audit was a well ordered and educational experience for the OSTIF team. While we hope this report will reach those who are able to best benefit from documented FOSS security audits, we know that the work itself will reach all those who depend on c-ares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, X41 found the c-ares library to be well designed and implemented. The audit found six inconsistencies during the process. Three vulnerabilities were rated as medium, three others as informational. Alongside performing static manual code review, the X41 team implemented and customized AFL++ fuzzers during this audit. Recently, AFL++ fuzzers have been made to support command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing, which was important to this audit as c-ares is made up of multiple CLI tooling components in its code base. While the audit particularly focused on memory corruption vulnerabilities which are common in C libraries, two of the medium vulnerabilities were categorized as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 330</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Use of Insufficiently Random Values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so grateful to the c-ares team, particularly their </span><a href="https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/releases"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine contributors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as X41’s fantastic staff for their efforts on this project. </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored this work and we are deeply appreciative of their support of open source security.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Generally speaking, OSTIF as well as the maintainers of the library deserve a lot of praise for their overall support and assistance. It was a pleasure for the testing team working with them.”</strong></span></p>
<p>-from the X41 Team on c-ares</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s our privilege to announce that OSTIF’s sixth security audit of 2023 is with l</span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libcap/libcap.git/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ibcap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! This was only possible with the fantastic work of </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and generous support of </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libcap is a library for getting and setting POSIX.1e draft 15 capabilities. The 26 year old project is maintained by Andrew G Morgan, a dedicated FOSS community member who was a joy to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identified in the process of this audit were 2 vulnerabilities, one medium (CVE-2023-2603) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and one low (CVE-2023-2602) severity, which guided the customization of multiple fuzz test harnesses for the project. X41 found that the libcap library necessitated the use of AFL++ fuzzing due to the memory corruption vulnerabilities commonly found in C. This was performed in coordination with ASAN (address space sanitizers). The found low severity vulnerability was in fact memory leak related, and the medium had to do with integer overflow on 32bit systems with a specific byte size. These were both addressed before publication of this blog. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would very much like to thank the OSTIF and X41 D-Sec for organizing and completing a thorough and timely audit of the libcap project code. The written audit report is well structured, clear and insightful and I&#8217;m happy that libcap-2.69 has addressed the issues it has uncovered.”  -Andrew G. Morgan</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF would like to thank X41 D-sec for their hard work and perpetual dedication to FOSS security. Their <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/news/2023/05/15/libcap-source-code-audit/">blog can be found here</a> with further details of this project. We extend our gratitude to Amazon Web Services for their sponsorship of this audit and by extension, important security work being performed in open source. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is pleased to announce that another audit has reached publication! A security audit of simplejson’s source code was conducted in collaboration with X41. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found during the audit process were one medium and two low severity issues, as well as nine more informational issues. In addition, custom differential fuzzing harnesses were made to compare C and Python implementations of simplejson with differential fuzzing across simplejson and orjson to ascertain parsing discrepancies in the two libraries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41’s work in the Python encoder/decoder supported previous security research in simplejson. A mature project like simpejson has many maintainers and contributors over its long life, yet there were still minor fissures in the code that were addressed and patched. The efforts provided by a skilled third-party reviewer can help mature projects further their security concerns and goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank X41 for their continued work with OSTIF in helping open source projects navigate the complex security space. Also, thank you to Amazon Web Services for sponsoring this critically important work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to </span><a href="https://github.com/etrepum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Ippolito</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of simplejson, whose collaboration and openness to working with us made the effort all the more impactful. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many open source projects such as simplejson are developed by volunteers without funding, sponsorship, or dedicated security resources, yet they have become embedded in infrastructure where security is critical. The OSTIF funded security audit of simplejson performed by X41 D-Sec was thorough; it identified potential security issues (minor, in this case) and included several specific recommendations for security hardening that will help the project remain safe to use. Even as a solo maintainer, it was a breeze to work with OSTIF and X41 D-Sec. The entire engagement from their initial email to the release of simplejson v3.9.1 took less than a month, just a few emails and one meeting on my end before receiving the initial report. I&#8217;d highly recommend working with OSTIF to other open source maintainers, and if I was still a decision maker at a corporation I&#8217;d devote resources to sponsoring this important work!” </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Bob Ippolito, simplejson </span></i></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>First, we&#8217;d like to thank everyone in the community who donated to the cause and made this happen. Our crucial work does not happen without donations from people who care about our cause. If security and privacy on the web matter to you, there&#8217;s a huge number of ways to support us. You can add us to Amazon Smile for free and they will donate a small percentage of their profits to us. You can donate directly using a dozen different methods on the site. You can tell your employer about us. You can go to the community and spread the word. You can volunteer and get involved. Even following our work on social media helps us spread the word. On Twitter we are <a href="https://twitter.com/OSTIFofficial">@ostifofficial</a> and on Reddit we are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ostifofficial/">/u/ostifofficial</a> .</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1>The project: <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound DNS</a></h1>
<p>From the Unbound website: &#8220;Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features based on open standards.To help increase online privacy, Unbound supports DNS-over-TLS which allows clients to encrypt their communication. In addition, it supports various modern standards that limit the amount of data exchanged with authoritative servers. These standards do not only improve privacy but also help making the DNS more robust. The most important are Query Name Minimization, the Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache and support for authority zones, which can be used to load a copy of the root zone.Unbound runs on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MacOS, Linux and Microsoft Windows, with packages available for most platforms. It is included in the base-system of FreeBSD and OpenBSD and in the standard repositories of most Linux distributions. Installation and configuration is designed to be easy. Setting up a resolver for your machine or network can be done with only a few lines of configuration.It is free, open source software under the BSD license. The guiding principles for our product development roadmap are first and foremost the security and privacy of the user. In addition, all functionality must be backed by well established open standards. We continually improve the functionality of Unbound for all of our users&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Scope</h1>
<p>The audit was designed to locate bugs and weaknesses in design that impact the security of servers running Unbound DNS. A combination of manual code auditing, dynamic analysis using a custom fuzzing harness, and<br />
static analysis was used to perform the audit.</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Broad Strokes</h1>
<p>Both the audit team and the Unbound team are happy with the results as they are shown. This project led to a total of 48 changes in unbound that either improve security or fix minor issues that could lead to future security problems as the application grows and evolves over time. The consensus is that Unbound has greatly benefited from the work and that the users and applications that depend on it are now safer than they were prior to our work. A patch will be released tomorrow, December 12th 2019. A release candidate patch addressing all outstanding issues is here: <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/pipermail/unbound-users/2019-December/011930.html">https://nlnetlabs.nl/pipermail/unbound-users/2019-December/011930.html</a> all other outstanding issues were corrected in versions 1.9.4 and 1.9.5.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span></strong> = A patch was applied that corrects this issue.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span></strong> = Clarification given by the Unbound team indicates that the issue does not need patching for other reasons.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">DISPUTED</span></strong> = The Unbound team disagrees with the assessment.</p>
<p>If an issue does not have a status, it is because the issue is still being discussed between the teams. It does not indicate a dispute, only that OSTIF does not know the current status. The status of the issues will be updated here as we learn more about them.</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Detailed Audit Results</h1>
<p>One Critical, Five High, and Five Medium severity issues were found, with an additional 39 issues that were rated as low or informational severity.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18934">CVE-2019-18934</a> &#8211; <span style="color: #993366;">CRITICAL</span> &#8211; Shell Injection in IPSECMOD<br />
</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED in commit 09845779d5f2c96e3064ff398cad65c08357cfbf </span></p>
<p>When using the IPSECMOD module, a malicious DNS response from a client can inject commands into the host machine.</p>

</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED in commit b60c4a472c856f0a98120b7259e991b3a6507eb5</span></p>
<p>A use-after-free issue in worker_handle_request() can lead to remote code execution or denial of service.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">HIGH</span> &#8211; Config Injection in create_unbound_ad_servers.sh<br />
</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED in commit f887552763477a606a9608b0f6b498685e0f6587</span></p>
<p>The bash script in contrib/create_unbound_ad_servers.sh does not properly sanitize the retrieved data before it is outputted into a configuration file. This allows to modify the configuration by having several statements on a single line. Since the input is retrieved via unencrypted, unauthenticated HTTP an attacker on the wire might be able to abuse this issue.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">HIGH</span> &#8211; Integer Overflow in Regional Allocator<br />

<p>When the regional allocator in util/regional.c is used to allocate memory via regional_alloc() integer overflows can happen. If size is big enough the first call to malloc() will have a parameter that is<br />
smaller than expected. Furthermore the macro ALIGN_UP could overflow causing r-&gt;<em>available</em> to point at a bad memory location.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">HIGH</span> &#8211; Integer Overflow in sldns_str2wire_dname_buf_origin()<br />
</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED in commit a3545867fcdec50307c776ce0af28d07046a52dd</span></p>
<p>The function sldns_str2wire_dname_buf_origin() in sldns/str2wire.c converts a string to dname wireformat, concatenating with origin when the domain name is relative. Several checks are performed to avoid a buffer overflow when writing the result into buf. Nevertheless, when dlen + origin_len is bigger than sizeof(size_t), the calculation will wrap around, resulting in the value of the addition being smaller than the operands. When this happens, the checks might be bypassed and could lead to memmove() writing out of bounds. An out of bounds write produces unexpected results and can usually be abused by an attacker to gain remote code execution.</p>

</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED in commit fa23ee8f31ba9a018c720ea822faaee639dc7a9c</span></p>
<p>The function sldns_bget_token_par() in sldns/parse.c returns a token from a buffer. While parsing the input buffer, char by char, certain inputs will result in a write and increment to the token buffer without checking boundary limits. A specially crafted input could repeatedly trigger this unbounded write and eventually perform a write outside of token ’s bounds. An out of bounds write produces unexpected results and can usually be abused by an attacker to gain remote code execution.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">MEDIUM</span> &#8211; Assert Causing DoS in synth_cname()<br />
</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED in commit f5e06689d193619c57c33270c83f5e40781a261d</span></p>
<p>It is possible to trigger an log_assert() in synth_cname() by sending invalid packets to the server. This issue should not be fixed by disabling asserts, as this raises an additional possible integer underflow issue. If asserts are disabled during compilation, this might lead to an out of bounds write in dname_pkt_copy() since the computation alias+(qnamelen-dname_rrset-&gt;dname_len) might become negative due to an underflow.</p>

<p>In different files and functions sizes are calculated that are later passed on to different allocation functions such as malloc(). Several of these cases are not protected against integer overflows.</p>

</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED in commit 2d444a5037acff6024630b88092d9188f2f5d8fe</span></p>
<p>In dname_pkt_copy() an infinite loop can be caused by the input data \xC0\x00. This will cause the LABEL_IS_PTR macro to return true and set lablen to 0, causing the checking to start at the beginning of the input again. Additionally, the log_assert() can be triggered quite easily, leading to another DoS.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">MEDIUM</span> &#8211; Out of Bound Write Compressed Names in rdata_copy()<br />
</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED in commit 6c3a0b54ed8ace93d5b5ca7b8078dc87e75cd640</span></p>
<p>In rdata_copy(), if the len parameter becomes bigger than the size of the packet (pkt_len ), the memmove() is performed before the check in log_assert().<em> It seems that, due to the fact that packets are first parsed by other functions that check for</em><br />
<em>unbounded pointers, this might not be exploitable.</em></p>
