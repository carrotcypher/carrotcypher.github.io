										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Results of Git Security Audit</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) is thrilled to announce the results of a security audit and threat model for <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>. Git is the world&#8217;s most widely used version control system, and it underpins not only open source, but the vast majority of public and private software development today. To say that git is infrastructure is an understatement, it reaches nearly every corner of software development and touches nearly every product that has software in one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, git is one of OSTIFs top priorities to help with security resources and has built a large coalition of companies to work on multiple facets of the git project. The security audit conducted by Markus Vervier and Eric Sesterhenn from <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/">X41</a> and Joern Schneeweisz from <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is only a part of the total efforts coordinated by OSTIF. <a href="https://github.com/">Github&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://codeql.github.com/">CodeQL team</a> (thank you Turbo!) is helping the git developers build a custom ruleset for CodeQL to help give the developers more meaningful results and cull false positives so that the tool is more usable than the previous static analysis tools (that the core git team had stopped using due to multiple difficulties). Additionally, Adolfo Veytia and John Speed Meyers from <a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/">Chainguard</a> along with Dennis Appelt from GitLab are working on how the Windows version of git is distributed to make recommendations and changes to improve the supply chain security of git. We will be releasing the results of those efforts as each of these projects is completed. This coalition of efforts is unified through our shared interests in git and the critical role that it plays in the open source world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is extremely grateful for the funding and support from the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/shared-success-in-building-a-safer-open-source-community/">Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST)</a> and the help of the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a> to help make this critical project more secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this portion of the research a total of 35 issues were discovered, including 2 critical severity findings and a high severity finding. Additionally, because of this research, a number of potentially catastrophic security bugs were discovered and resolved internally by the git security team. (A special thank you to Patrick Steinhardt for all of their work on the formatting issues related to CVE-2022-41903).<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The serious bug fixes are in the latest release of Git (released today).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The most notable issues were:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CRITICAL</strong> &#8211; CVE-2022-41903 &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-475x-2q3q-hvwq">Out-of-Bounds Memory Write in Log Formatting</a> (this had multiple collateral issues that were fixed by the git security team that were critical in nature)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CRITICAL</strong> &#8211; CVE-2022-23251 &#8211; Truncated Allocation Leading to Out of Bounds Write Via Large Number of Attributes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>HIGH</strong> &#8211; Out-of-Bounds Read Via Padding Placeholders</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The git team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by actively participating in the audit process and collaborating with the audit team during the initial meetings and security review. We&#8217;d like to thank everyone at git who helped us with this audit, with security tooling questions, and with understanding the git build process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results can be viewed in full detail at the following links:</span></p>

OSTIF is planning many security efforts in 2023, and funding audits like these can be a useful tool for securing projects in open source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to everyone from <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/">X41</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> that did excellent work on this audit!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on this type of security work being done, visit the OSTIF website. <a href="https://github.com/Amir-Montazery/OSTIF/blob/main/Completed-Engagements.md">We also have all of our published work on our Github</a>. Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Everyone around the world depends on open source software (OSS), and security audits play an important role in securing the open source ecosystem.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is thrilled to report the results of a security audit of </span><a href="https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRI-O</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRI-O</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an open source software (OSS) project </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It can run any OCI-compatible container, providing an enormous number of applications and environments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary security finding of the work is a single high-severity issue. A few minor issues were found as well, however, the Audit Team’s view from completing this engagement is that CRI-O is a well-written project that has a high level of security assurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high severity finding is a denial of service attack on a given cluster by way of resource exhaustion of nodes. The attack is performed by way of pod creation, which means any user that can create a pod can cause denial of service on the given node that is used for pod creation. The CVE for the this vulnerability is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CVE-2022-1708 and Github advisory can be found here: </span><a href="https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the denial of service attack also occurred in other container runtime interface implementations, most notably Containerd. Specifically, the exact same attack that exhausts memory in CRI-O can be used to exhaust memory of Containerd. The CVE for this issue in containerd is CVE-2022-31030 and the Github security advisory can be found here: </span><a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, an extensive fuzzing suite targeting the CRI-O infrastructure was integrated as a result of this engagement, providing long-lasting improvements to the security posture of the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, we commissioned </span><a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainguard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to perform a dedicated Supply Chain Security Assessment of CRI-O as part of the security audit. The assessment was designed to analyze CRI-O practices and recommend steps and strategies to increase </span><a href="https://slsa.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLSA compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The full assessment can be found in the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CNCF) for funding this audit and entrusting Open Source Technology Improvement Fund to facilitate it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ada Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for auditing the software, Dan Lorenc and Adolfo García Veytia of Chainguard, and to the CRI-O team’s Peter Hunt and Mrunal Patel for their support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone around the world depends on OSS. We’d love to do more security audits to proactively find and fix vulnerabilities!
