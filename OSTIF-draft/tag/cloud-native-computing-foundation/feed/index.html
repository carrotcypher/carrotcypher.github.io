										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falco joins a </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/03/13/an-overview-of-the-cncf-and-ostif-impact-report-for-the-second-half-of-2022-and-early-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing number of CNCF Projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that completed a third-party security audit organized by OSTIF. A follow up to their </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/audits/SECURITY_AUDIT_2019_07.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Falco project requested a new engagement due to changes in the code base since. OSTIF partnered with </span><a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarkslab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to complete the audit. An overview of the results along with a link to the report can be found below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Security audits are a good practice for projects especially as their communities and users grow. The <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/05/18/cloud-native-maturity-model-2-0/">CNCF maturity model</a> is a good example of using policy and a strong support network to help projects improve their security posture. It’s an especially good practice to do follow-on audits as projects implement new code and features. I commend the Falco team for their efforts and commitment.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director of OSTIF. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Falco community is composed of information security experts that are passionate and committed to making all aspects of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secure as possible at every level. It has been a pleasure working with OSTIF and Quarkslab to not only assess the current level of security but to also design the most effective strategies to continuously verify and improve the security properties of the project. We are especially impressed by the depth and quality of the analysis performed and the clear and smooth communication </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luca Guerra, Falco Core Maintainer, Open Source Engineer at Sysdig</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As found in the report, “The goal of the audit was to assist the Falco maintainers to increase their security posture using static and dynamic analysis. Falco maintainers required an emphasis on fuzzing. To that end, Quarkslab’s engineers researched multiple topics to provide recommendations and relevant advice. In addition, Quarkslab’s engineers assessed the code in order to find some issues, using automated testing tools, fuzzing, or just by manually reviewing the code base.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engagement included a threat model along with Static and Dynamic analysis and mainly uncovered 1 Medium and a number of low and informational findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reviewing the report findings, Falco maintainers and contributors worked to address all the issues identified, enhance static and dynamic analysis pipelines and track longer term tasks. The overall goal is to establish continuous improvement projects to maintain the highest security standards in the codebase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Falco release team that worked on the </span><a href="https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-34-0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34.0 release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-34-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34.1 patch release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on Falco Libraries 0.10.3 and 0.10.4 addressed all medium and low severity findings, along with informational findings as well. Details on the issues, credits, patches and affected versions are tracked in the relevant </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/security/advisories"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repository’s Security Advisories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuously assessing the security of the codebase and making sure that potential weak points are caught and fixed early in the development process is extremely important for Falco maintainers and contributors; according to the report recommendations the static and dynamic analysis steps automatically performed have been enhanced, with more additions planned. For instance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/93ae6bb6098e7563f94738839715c2d7ee8f5ab5/.github/workflows/staticanalysis.yaml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CppCheck has been added</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Falco repository alongside other static analysis tools already present;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/master/semgrep"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semgrep has been added</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Falco Libs repository to prevent potentially dangerous functions from being introduced by contributors and enable more security focused checks in the future;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of AddressSanitizer, LeakSanitizer and similar tools </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/blob/33b2337c384b608049c8d619698396bd706ad98b/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L283"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been extended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to end to end testing to further improve memory leak, memory corruption, and error detection.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Falco community is also </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/issues/979"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new ideas for more ways to integrate additional static analysis, memory leak, and memory error detection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falco maintainers have also greatly appreciated the work that the Quarkslab team has done on fuzzing and dynamic analysis. The report reveals that building a robust fuzzer for Falco is a challenging task, and the Falco community intends to work on it based on the expertise shared in the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank Leonardo Grasso, Jason Dellaluce, Luca Guerra, and the rest of the Falco team for contributing time to collaborate with the audit team. Furthermore a big thank you to Mahé Tardy, Laurent Laubin, Victor Houal, and Ramtine Tofighi Shirazi for their diligent work.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Results of the Cilium Security Engagement</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">About Cilium</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cilium.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cilium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an open source software for providing, securing and observing network connectivity between container workloads, powered by </span><a href="https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eBPF sandboxing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the linux kernel. It provides cloud-native network security and observability while maintaining strong security properties itself. Similar tools without eBPF have to run at high privileges and can increase security risks, giving Cilium a unique advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cilium joins a </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/08/08/improving-cncf-security-posture-with-independent-security-audits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing list </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Cloud Native Computing Foundation Projects (CNCF) audited to improve security posture and help reach </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">graduated status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thanks to strategic partner OSTIF. A combination of threat modeling, manual code review and automated testing tools were used for this engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit went exceptionally well, with only a handful of medium severity and low/informational issues discovered. The most notable issue was a mutex lock discovered in the Envoy component. A full list of the issues discovered in Cilium can be found in the report at the bottom of this page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tooling Updates and Security Posture Improvements</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the engagement the ADA Logics team created fuzzers for both the project and its critical dependencies. A total of 13 fuzzers were written, including 10 for Cilium’s critical functions and policy handling, and an additional 3 fuzzers for the widely used netlink dependency. At the time of this writing, the three fuzzers for netlink have not been integrated into ossfuzz for continuous fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a lightweight threat model was developed for Cilium that helps contributors and consumers of Cilium understand from a security perspective how Cilium works, and informs users on the attack surface of Cilium, and more importantly, helps contributors to understand how changes to code as the project grows and matures can affect the security of Cilium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADA Logics team also recommended that a document covering how to use Cilium securely should be created to help users understand and manage their configuration of Cilium. The Cilium team </span><a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/23599"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is working on creating that document now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Security Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cilium meets most of the requirements for SLSA level 3 (and 4), but does not generate a provenance document with its builds. It does however generate a Software Bill of Materials with each release, and the Cilium team </span><a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/22740"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has started to actively track SLSA compliance here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank the Cilium maintainers from </span><a href="https://isovalent.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isovalent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the audit team at </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their help and collaboration on this engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for sponsoring the audit and entrusting OSTIF to get the work done. We are truly grateful for the opportunity to help make critical cloud computing infrastructure more secure and sustainable. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited to report the results for the security audit of <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage">Backstage</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://backstage.io/">Backstage</a> is a software catalog and development platform that enables teams to quickly ship high-quality code. The security review was facilitated by <a href="https://ostif.org/">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> backed by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> and carried out by <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/">X41 D-Sec</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. The Backstage team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by requesting independent review and actively participating in the audit process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the security audit are 12 security findings (2 Critical, 2 High, 5 Medium, 3 Low) as well as 15 other security hardening recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The serious issues identified through this engagement have been fixed and validated by the x41 team. See below for the full report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big thank you to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for supporting the work and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding the audit. Furthermore, thank you to the X41 team for executing the audit and working with us to make and validate fixes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also special thanks to Helen Greul, Patrik Oldsberg, Himanshu Mishra Francesco Corti, Lee Mills, Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn for their roles in the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Everyone around the world depends on OSS, and we would love to do more security audits!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is thrilled to report the results of a security audit of </span><a href="https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRI-O</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRI-O</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an open source software (OSS) project </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It can run any OCI-compatible container, providing an enormous number of applications and environments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary security finding of the work is a single high-severity issue. A few minor issues were found as well, however, the Audit Team’s view from completing this engagement is that CRI-O is a well-written project that has a high level of security assurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high severity finding is a denial of service attack on a given cluster by way of resource exhaustion of nodes. The attack is performed by way of pod creation, which means any user that can create a pod can cause denial of service on the given node that is used for pod creation. The CVE for the this vulnerability is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CVE-2022-1708 and Github advisory can be found here: </span><a href="https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the denial of service attack also occurred in other container runtime interface implementations, most notably Containerd. Specifically, the exact same attack that exhausts memory in CRI-O can be used to exhaust memory of Containerd. The CVE for this issue in containerd is CVE-2022-31030 and the Github security advisory can be found here: </span><a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, an extensive fuzzing suite targeting the CRI-O infrastructure was integrated as a result of this engagement, providing long-lasting improvements to the security posture of the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, we commissioned </span><a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainguard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to perform a dedicated Supply Chain Security Assessment of CRI-O as part of the security audit. The assessment was designed to analyze CRI-O practices and recommend steps and strategies to increase </span><a href="https://slsa.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLSA compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The full assessment can be found in the report. </span></p>
