<h2>What are we working on?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a></span> powers everything. 70% of the top million websites use OpenSSL to provide encryption services to their visitors and to encrypt user information. It&#8217;s in thousands of apps, and the internet as we know it relies on OpenSSL to protect our information.</p>
<p>The NSA has tried to compromise OpenSSL before, by<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/01/14/hopefully-last-post-ill-ever-write-on/">introducing weakened standards</a> </span>and<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-rsa/exclusive-secret-contract-tied-nsa-and-security-industry-pioneer-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220">bribing companies to use those weakened components</a></span>.</p>
<p>OpenSSL is getting a major update with version 1.1.1, called<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.eweek.com/security/tls-1.3-encryption-standard-moves-forward-improving-internet-security">TLS 1.3</a>.</span> It is a new set of security standards and cryptography for the next generation of encryption. There&#8217;s a lot of new code, new options, and new features.</p>
<p>We need to publicly review this code to make sure that it is as safe as possible. Specific areas that the NSA has attacked before (the Pseudorandom Number Generator or PRNG) are getting big updates and need to be independently verified.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want another compromised PRNG, Heartbleed, Logjam, FREAK, or CCS Injection problem to slip through the cracks. We need to ensure that OpenSSL is safe for all of us to use long into the future.</p>
<p>For more technical details on the scope of the audit, look here: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/">https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/</a></span></p>
<p><strong>These projects do not happen without your support. Tell your friends. Spread the word. Donate. We need to build a safer internet together.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Double Your Donations With CrowdRise</h1>
<p>Today, we begin our second round of funding in partnership with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, who will be matching Crowdrise donations for the next four weeks!</p>
<p>You can view the Crowdrise campaign and donate here to have your donation matched (doubled): <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/">https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/</a></p>
<h2>OpenSSL 1.1.1 Project Changes</h2>
<p>We have made changes to the proposed OpenSSL project to bring down costs while still allocating enough resources to ensure that a complete and thorough audit is completed.</p>
<p>The original plan was for all OpenSSL components in the scope to be reviewed by two separate teams, one at Kudelski and one at QuarksLab. This was costly and redundant work that greatly inflated the cost of the project and has delayed fundraising and completion.</p>
<p>To trim down costs, we have:</p>
<p>-Removed Kudelski as our secondary auditor (they were the higher of the two bids).</p>
<p>-Added Jean-Phillipe Aumasson specifically to review the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) changes.</p>
<p>-Removed overhead costs such as t-shirts and other giveaways that greatly inflate the costs of the fundraising.</p>
<p>These changes reduced our overall cost of the project substantially and our project fundraising goal is <strong>LESS THAN HALF</strong> of what it was originally.</p>
<p>We now only need to raise a total of $150,000 to meet our goal and fully fund the project. We are already over halfway there!</p>
<p>The goal on CrowdRise ($70000) represents the funds that we need to raise to complete the OpenSSL project.</p>
