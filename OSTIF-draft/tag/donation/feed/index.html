										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DuckDuckGo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the privacy search engine, has contributed to OSTIF for a third time by donating $25,000 USD. The charitable giving as part of DuckDuckGo’s annual program </span><a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/2022-duckduckgo-charitable-donations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread Privacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is special, as the funds are not allocated to any specific project. This contribution helps OSTIF tremendously and allows the organization to be more sustainable. Resources will be allocated to overhead costs and help OSTIF make more security improvements to critical open source projects than ever before in 2023 (like the recent research on </span><a href="https://ostif.org/the-ostif-audit-of-curl-with-trail-of-bits-is-complete/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">curl</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a href="https://ostif.org/the-audit-of-git-is-complete/">git</a>.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are grateful and honored for the community and to be supported alongside organizations like </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raising the standard of trust on the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a special thank you to Katie and everyone from DuckDuckGo for helping to make this happen!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duckduckgo</a>, the privacy search engine, has contributed to OSTIF for a second time by donating $25,000 USD. Their site that tracks their charitable donations <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/2021-duckduckgo-donations/">Spread Privacy</a> has the official announcement.</p>
<p>These funds are not allocated to any specific project, which helps OSTIF tremendously by allowing us to spend resources on overhead costs of doing business that the organization needs to spend money on to function. Most of our funding from corporate donors comes with specific projects in mind and doesn&#8217;t significantly help the core organization function.</p>
<p>Duckduckgo originally donated to OSTIF for <a href="https://ostif.org/the-veracrypt-audit-results/">our first project, VeraCrypt</a>, which helped prove that our concept worked and ultimately led to where we are today, nearly six years later. Their continued support shows their commitment to keeping the open source projects we rely on secure.</p>
<p>And a special thank you to Katie and Charlie for helping to make this happen!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have set up the infrastructure to enable donations via Monero.</p>
<p><a href="https://getmonero.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Monero</span></a> is a fully open-source and decentralized cryptocurrency that improves on the privacy shortcomings of Bitcoin through obfuscation technologies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3AHp9KgTkQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">RingCT</span></a> and is currently working on an i2p based routing system to further privatize transactions, called <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Kovri</span></a>.</p>
<p>The Monero project has been instrumental in improving on privacy weaknesses in traditional cryptocurrencies, and they have had strong development progress and incident response.</p>
<p>Our Monero donation information will appear on the <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">donate page</span></a> in the coming days.</p>
