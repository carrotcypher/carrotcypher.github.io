										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today OSTIF is thrilled to release the Independent Security Audit Impact Report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This report is the culmination of over a year’s worth of work that OSTIF organized thanks to funding from Google and OpenSSF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am extremely proud of this work and what OSTIF continues to accomplish. Organizations like Google, OpenSSF, and many others are eager to fund initiatives that help secure the open source ecosystem, and I firmly believe that OSTIF is one of the best outlets for doing just that. We were able to take almost $1,000,000 and turn it into significant security improvements to critical projects in one year.” </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director, OSTIF </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF sincerely thanks Google and OpenSSF for funding this work. More support and funding will result in more engagements and security improvements. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The OSTIF Public Books Have Been Updated &#8211; October 2017</h1>
<p>We have updated our 2017 Books to current, and they can be viewed here:   <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM"><span style="color: #0000ff;">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Highlights since the last major update of the books:</span></p>
<p>-Private Internet Access has become our first Platinum Sponsor. This means that they have committed to contributing $120,000 USD per year, and will be joining our steering committee, where they will participate in monthly meetings with us directly and help give us feedback and support on our projects.</p>
<p>-We have raised approximately $127,000 so far toward the <a href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenSSL 1.1.1 project</span></a>, putting us at about 30% of our goal after 10 days of fundraising. We anticipate having the project funded by the end of November if fundraising continues at our current pace.</p>
<p>-We paid a total of $5129 to Guido Vranken for finding 7 low to medium severity bugs in OpenVPN, and for helping to integrate the fuzzing tools that he created into the project, which helps permanently prevent these types of bugs from resurfacing in OpenVPN in the future.</p>
<p>-We purchased a BeagleBone Black for a future unannounced YouTube guide video.</p>
<p>-We spent $450 to have our closing bumper for our YouTube channel professionally filmed and recorded.</p>
<h3>We remain committed to maximum transparency about our operations and goals. All of this exists because of our support from the public. If you support our mission be sure to donate and spread the word about our mission to everyone you know. This dream depends on all of us to succeed. We can have a safer and more private internet.</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/ostifs-2017-books-have-been-updated/">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund&#8217;s Open Books for 2017</a></h1>
<p>We have been late to the party on updating our open books for 2017. I have gone through and updated them finally today.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM</a></p>
<h2>The big items of note:</h2>
<p>-The OpenVPN Fundraiser has concluded and we <strong>beat our goals by a comfortable margin</strong>. These excess funds are being reserved for the bug bounty program which we aim to have active by the end of the FY2017.</p>
<p>-Our Paypal donations have been moved into our general funds account.</p>
<p>-We have liquidated all of our Bitcoins for USD. We sold our Bitcoins on an exchange on February 26th at an exchange rate of $1202 : 1 BTC, giving us a nice boost over the value of the BTC donations when they were made in November and December 2016.</p>
<p>-Most of the liquidated BTC funds have been moved to the general funds account.</p>
<h2>Future Liabilities:</h2>
<p>-We still need to pay for the OpenVPN audit by QuarksLab upon its conclusion.</p>
<p>-We still need to pay for T-shirt printing related to the OpenVPN fundraiser. While the first rounds of shirts has been printed and shipped, they contain some subtle misprinting errors and will need to be re-printed and re-shipped. The printer has agreed to eat the cost of reprinting the shirts in exchange for us shouldering the cost of the re-shipping.</p>
<p>We are not expecting these liabilities to exceed $66,500 in total costs to OSTIF.</p>
<p>Keep checking with us for more updates!</p>
<p>-Derek</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/?p=800&amp;preview=true"><b>2015 and 2016 financial report for the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc.</b></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 was a year of rapid growth for OSTIF. We&#8217;ve met or exceeded all of our goals and have two major successes under our belts, the fundraising and auditing of VeraCrypt 1.18 and the fundraising and auditing of OpenVPN 2.4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This document is intended to inform our donors and the public about our operations and their related expenses. It is to show how our money is spent, and give ourselves a tool to evaluate how we are performing with regard to our goals and aspirations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this is our first full year of operation, we will be including our 2015 expenses and revenue in our figures displayed in this document. Because 2015 was a revenue-neutral year in which our activities were largely made up of planning our 2016 strategy and building our web assets, this will actually make our numbers look slightly worse for technology expenses and administrative spending. 2015 included a lot of one-time costs to form and register the corporation and attain non-profit status that will not be expenses for OSTIF in future years.</span></p>
<p><b>Let’s start with our fundraising:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across 2015 and 2016 we raised a total of </span><b>$125,782</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which greatly exceeded our expenses of </span><b>$94,544 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives us an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">excess pool</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of about $30,000 which we can apply toward our bug-bounty program. We are careful to use the word</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because much of our holdings are currently in Bitcoins, and the exchange rate of BTC has fluctuated over 20% in the past few weeks, so the exact amount of our holdings fluctuates in value with the exchange rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found our stride in 2016 and our strategy of coalition building and bringing industry partners together to make effective change is going very well. We expect to continue this growth throughout 2017 and beyond!</span></p>
<p><b>Expense breakdown and goals:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across 2015 and 2016 we spent a total of $94,544 ($1,705 in 2015 and $92,838 in 2016). These expenses are broken down into 5 categories. You can see the categories and their descriptions below:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charity</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are expenses that are related to our actual charitable activities. This spending is for auditing, bug bounties, and grants paid to projects that we support.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administrative Costs</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are costs like keeping the corporation and its nonprofit status registered with state and federal agencies.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is pay for our managers. Each manager does not draw a salary, but gets a bonus of 2% of the value of a fundraiser. This keeps our expenses low while still providing incentive to perform.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Costs</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes costs like consulting, web hosting, DDoS hardening, purchasing SSL certificates, and more.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotional Costs</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are small promotional costs for things like T-shirts and licensing for music/art for OSTIF guide videos.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expense breakdown:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><strong>On the left we have our original targets and on the right we have our results.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have beaten our goals that were laid out in 2015, even while including the large one-time costs of getting the organization started! Even after those costs, 91.2% of our revenue has gone directly to helping open-source projects get stronger (or is unspent waiting for the next project). Technology costs are our largest overhead expense, making up 1.5% of our expenses, with administrative costs next in line at 0.9% of our expenses. We spent so little on promotional costs that it cannot accurately be displayed on the chart. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking Forward to 2017:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are expecting the percentages for all of these overhead costs to fall further in 2017 as our revenue grows. These are fixed expenses that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grow with the size of the organization. We will be looking for new opportunities for efficient spending and marketing in 2017 to help grow our charity and expand our reach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We plan to greatly expand the educational side of our business throughout 2017 and will be more focused on guiding users on how to use our supported software. This may include new small costs like licenses for music, licenses for operating systems, the purchase of basic equipment for demonstrations, or other small expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also expect some travel expenses to creep into our budget over time, as we will likely be attending trade shows and making in-person solicitations for support in mid to late 2017. This may also include small expenses like printing costs for brochures and business cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We remain committed to our 90% efficiency target. We will continue to tightly control our expenses and <strong>keep costs low</strong>. We are proud to be among the most efficient charities of the world, and an increase in funding will only increase our performance per dollar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to extend a special thank you to all of our early supporters who have helped make OSTIF a success. We look forward to working with the community to create a safe internet for all of us!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>OSTIF Transparency &#8211; We are opening up our books</h1>
<p>Edit: Our public books were last updated on 9/16/2016</p>
<p>In an effort to increase our transparency about where money in our organization goes, we are opening up our books to scrutiny by the public. You can see how our money is spent and when. We invite any criticism you may have about our operations or efficiency. We are designed from the ground-up to be a lean organization that puts a strong focus on our funds going to our supported projects.</p>
<p>You can view the full document here:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bpt0ZTP0Xnsfl-1gduSGsrFEbSeOTTCeHhfkvGspAcs/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bpt0ZTP0Xnsfl-1gduSGsrFEbSeOTTCeHhfkvGspAcs/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>This document is intended to be a permanent rolling record that will be periodically updated to reflect the latest donations and charges to our accounts.</p>
<p>Note: Separate accounts, such as accounts for social media campaigns, Paypal, crowdsourcing, and other sources are not shown in this document until the money is deposited into our corporate account. This is both to ease record-keeping on the public document, and so that donations can be rolled together into groups so that individual contributions do not stand out unless the donor specifically requests otherwise.</p>
<p>We are committed to running an open, trustworthy, and focused organization. If you have any comments or professional advice for us that you would like to contribute, feel free to contact us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is now a Tax-Exempt Charity</h2>
<p>Today we received official word from the US Department of the Treasury, that our application for 501c3 non-profit status has been accepted. This means that we are now exempt from being taxed as a corporation in the United States, and that people from the US who contribute to our cause can now write off those contributions as charitable, making all US contributions, even by corporations, tax-free.</p>
<p>This news allows us to move forward with our plans to seek aid from US companies and organizations that donate to causes like ours. It also adds legitimacy to our organization so that we can increase trust in our platform and how we manage our organization.</p>
<p>We plan to continue bolstering this effort by reaching out to other organizations who align with our ideas, and asking that they partner with us to achieve our mutually aligned goals. We are beginning this effort with reaching out to the Electronic Frontier Foundation for an Observer to oversee our finances and our plans. This will allow an outside party to verify that our goals are reasonable, our spending is responsible, and that we can be trusted with your donations to do the good that we want to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our KickStarter has just ended and we have learned a lot about how to raise money for our supported projects. We faced a number of challenges that were difficult to overcome in the short window that we had while the KickStarter was live. We have extensively evaluated every aspect of the effort and got tons of feedback from donors and potential donors on how to improve our processes. Our graphic below shows the changes we are making to the fundraising process. The goal is to simplify and streamline the process so that we can focus our energy on a single project at a time, and have a concrete message about what we want to do for that project.</p>
<h1>The lessons that we learned from our first crowdsourcing effort.</h1>
<p>The experience gave us a huge amount of information on how to conduct our efforts going forward, and allows us to narrow our focus on our goals and getting things done. Below are the areas that we have identified that we need to resolve before our next fundraiser.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Our fundraising effort was too broad.  </strong>This muddied our message and goals, and made our goals very hard to describe in a straight forward and easy to understand way. Our feedback indicated that people did not understand completely <span style="color: #000000;">what</span> we do, the software that we support already exists and it is available for use now. The original hope was that we could combine all of the efforts into a single large KickStarter hoping that we could catch small donations from users of the various projects, and it would add up to the sums that we need to raise in order to accomplish our goals. It had the opposite effect, making the KickStarter goals vague and dissuading donors from donating because we had no system in place for users to earmark money for the project that they prefer. We plan to remedy this by doing focused crowdsourcing campaigns for supported applications. This allows us to focus our message on a particular app rather than a broad abstract concept.</li>
<li><strong>KickStarter backers want some sort of &#8220;value&#8221; from their donation.</strong> Backers on KickStarter generally do not donate solely out of kindness. We did have KickStarter rewards, but our costs were relatively high on those rewards, and this meant that we had to raise significantly more money than our actual goal in order to compensate for the Certificates and T-Shirts. We are revisiting this rewards system to both bring down costs and bring down our donation rewards thresholds. This will allow us to do more with smaller donations, and donors will feel that they are getting a better value for their product.</li>
<li><strong>The privacy community is insular and resistant to new entrants.</strong> We expected stronger community support on social media from the security and privacy community. The response was lackluster to say the least. Everyone agreed that our goals were both important and reachable, but people were resistant to support the cause on social media. This greatly limited our reach. We also had a lot of trouble reaching out to media groups and bloggers for public comments on our efforts. Most personalities in the privacy world simply ignored our requests and didn&#8217;t even ask us questions or respond to requests for comment. To build trust with our potential donors, we are working with well-known groups in the community to get &#8220;observers&#8221; on the project who will look over our processes, contracts, goals and fundraising and verify that everything is in good order and reasonable. We also think that getting a single audit under our belts will give people more confidence that we can handle actually achieving our goals and delivering results.</li>
<li><strong>The vast majority of the potential backers on crowdsourcing sites are unfamiliar with our supported software. </strong>This leads to issues with converting potential donors to backers of our projects. People do not know what the software does or what it is for. This problem will be made simpler by focusing our message on a single piece of software in smaller funding projects. We plan to also tackle this problem by posting thorough guides on what the software does, how it works, and showing in detail how to use the software through intuitive videos. We think that showing the usefulness of the software, as well as giving people an avenue to use it themselves without having to read complex manuals will help to bring about more conversions and get us more donations.</li>
<li><strong>KickStarter may not be the best crowdsourcing venue for our project. </strong>The &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; nature of KickStarter, combined with some high profile KickStarter failures (that were making the rounds on news websites during our campaign) definitely hurt our chances of securing donations. This was especially true as our cause was not a &#8220;gadget&#8221; type product that enticed direct donations in exchange for a tangible product. We will continue to use crowdsourcing for our project, but we may seek alternatives to the KickStarter platform.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Our first major change is the way that we are going to structure our fundraisers.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-387 size-large" src="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kickstarter-End-742x1024.png" alt="Kickstarter End" width="742" height="1024" srcset="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kickstarter-End-742x1024.png 742w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kickstarter-End-217x300.png 217w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kickstarter-End-768x1060.png 768w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kickstarter-End.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></p>
<p>Working on these five areas should allow us to have much greater success going into 2016.  We will be posting more about our schedule and when and where you can find our next major fundraiser.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Transparency &#8211; OSTIF Operational Efficiency and Salaries</h1>
<p>The OSTIF board has discussed at length the issues of pay, overhead and efficiency for the organization. We have tackled the issue and are hoping to meet or exceed our goals for keeping overhead low and efficiency high, while rewarding successful campaigns and incentivizing good work. We also have created efficiency and overhead targets that we believe are in line with what any reasonable person would consider good for a charity.</p>
<p><a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/overhead-graph-final2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-228" src="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/overhead-graph-final2.png" alt="overhead graph final2" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/overhead-graph-final2.png 800w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/overhead-graph-final2-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Our goal is achieve 90% operational efficiency for funds that actually reach OSTIF. The numbers we show are for funds that we receive, so any fees or charges for transferring funds between accounts, or overhead charges such as Kickstarter fees, are not included in the figures as that money never actually reaches us.</p>
<p>Our desire is to both reward success as well as limit the impact of tough challenges. For this reason, all of the board has agreed that we should donate our time to the company and draw compensation in the form of bonuses. These bonuses will be 2% of the funds raised by OSTIF due to fundraising activities. This means that exactly 6% of the funds that are raised are shared among the three OSTIF members.</p>
<p>Other overhead is capped at 4% of total funds raised. While this is a goal and is not set in stone, we do everything reasonable to adhere to this standard. The main concern here is that fixed costs do not change with the size of the company or the success of our fundraising. We still need web hosting, we still need an SSL certificate, we still need to file for 501c3 status, and we still need legal advice, artists, and security consulting. Some of these expenses can be minimized, but they all have a floor in which we cannot cut them entirely without damaging the business.</p>
<p>Combined, this means that our goal is that 90% of our funds actually go toward <a href="https://ostif.org/ostif-supported-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSTIF supported projects</a>.</p>
<p>We do reserve the right to change this allocation of resources in the future, for example if we have to hire additional staff or wish to start awareness programs. However, whenever a reallocation of resources take place, it will be for all funds raised from that moment forward, unless special circumstances create additional challenges that we must meet (legal battles, etc).</p>
