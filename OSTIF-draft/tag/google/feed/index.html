										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications, worked with OSTIF and </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to help improve the project’s security posture. The multi-phased engagement, sponsored by Google, focused first on the triaging and closing of bugs, then upon further improving the core fuzzers that continually monitor for security issues using OSS-Fuzz infrastructure at </span><a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz."><span style="font-weight: 400">https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> This engagement is part of a series of security efforts to improve the security and reliability of Envoy. Earlier efforts include the </span><a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_envoy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">2018 Audit of Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by </span><a href="https://cure53.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cure53</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ada Logics</span></a> <a href="https://blog.envoyproxy.io/a-stroll-down-fuzzer-optimisation-lane-and-why-instrumentation-policies-matter-f0012ec260b3"><span style="font-weight: 400">fuzzing infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> work</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase I of the engagement was designed to help the Envoy Team reduce the number of open bugs identified, reduce noise in the existing fuzzers (so the Envoy team spends less time triaging non-issues), and improve fuzzing coverage where possible. OSTIF sourced four senior security experts from X41 D-sec to complete the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result of Phase I was the fixing of 68 security bugs. Furthermore, two critical vulnerabilities were found and proactively fixed. At the beginning of the Phase I engagement, there were 76 Total Fuzz Issues. As fixes and improvements were implemented, new fuzz issues were identified for analysis, allowing for further iteration and fine-tuning. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <strong>Figure 1: Total Fuzz Issues vs Fixed at end of Phase I </strong></span><strong>(Sept, 2022)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase II was focused on improving the number of executions/second and high signal to noise ratio produced by the fuzzers. Additionally to triaging remaining open high priority fuzzers from Phase I, there was an effort to close another 10 health check related fuzz issues. In order to cover more code faster, while remaining highly efficient and controlling output, X41 was able to analyze bugs from the first phase to determine how the fuzzers were running tests and where they were losing speed and validity. Of Envoy’s original 67 fuzzers, 19 were considered high priority due </span><span style="font-weight: 400">to testing code paths that are exposed to potential attack vectors; by dataplane traffic in the form of QoDs and bugs that can impact reliability and security of Envoy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Because Envoy is also offered as a service, fuzz testing and hardening the configuration interface is crucial.  When fuzzers work on data and configurations simultaneously, there can be a tendency for them to move away from configurations that need deeper testing. This results in less code coverage. Envoy’s code base uses debug assertions, which further slowed down the testing process and often returned noise. To combat and remediate these multiple consequences, X41’s team developed a plan. First, create a way to generate valid configuration files by introspecting the configuration description already augmented by expressions supplying context, and then develop a two-step fuzzing process with the configuration files generated then used for fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The team of Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild and Dr. Robert Femmer had to develop a way to address the set of points they identified as limiting the fuzzers functionality. They aimed to improve the critical fuzzers that run on HTTP decoders and stream management, specifically HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and the HTTP/3 codec interfaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Vehreschild and Dr. Femmer not only developed four new fuzzers, but improved the overall security testing environment of Envoy instrumentally. The created fuzzers targeted HTTP decoders for high throughput focused on primary attack surfaces of Http1 (Balsa and http_parser), Http2 (nghttp2 and oghttp2), and Http3 Quic. To address the issues around configuration files, the team experimented with running configurations repeatedly to explore the data plane deeper before generating another configuration. Configurations found could increase fuzzing speed by a factor of 4 to 20 times. Further work resulted in removing debug assertions and reducing the binary size of fuzzers by a factor of 1.5. By developing ways to create valid and long-running configurations across the configuration and data planes, the performance of fuzzers was increased by a factor of 40. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The graph below strongly suggests that, since </span>March 2022<span style="font-weight: 400"> when Phase I of the engagement began, there has been a downward trend in generation of new fuzz issues due to this collective effort. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-14-at-9.38.08-AM.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2991 size-full" src="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-14-at-9.38.08-AM.png" alt="" width="906" height="535" srcset="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-14-at-9.38.08-AM.png 906w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-14-at-9.38.08-AM-300x177.png 300w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-14-at-9.38.08-AM-768x454.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2: New Fuzz Issues since beginning of engagement (March 2022 &#8211; June, 2023)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work took months to complete and was an open discussion-based project that allowed for all members to collaborate, help each other, and discuss the possibilities and testing done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We sincerely thank Kirtimaan Rajshiva, Adi Peleg, Yan Avlasov, Harvey Tuch, Joshua Marantz, and the entire Envoy Platform Team for funding and guiding this effort along with Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild, Dr. Robert Femmer, and Sofie Seuren of X41 D-Sec for their diligent work and insight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate and improve security posture for the betterment of FOSS. We would also like to recognize Google, without whose funding this project would not have been possible.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited to report the results of a security audit of </span><a href="https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slf4j</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Simple Logging Facade for Java, slf4j, is identified in the </span><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/tools/census-ii-of-free-and-open-source-software-application-libraries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Census II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results as one of the most widely-deployed logging frameworks. The security and supply chain review was facilitated by </span><a href="https://ostif.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and carried out by </span><a href="https://includesecurity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. Upon review, it was found that slf4j has a very small attack surface area and does not support post-processing of logging messages that may be cause for security concern, such as the </span><a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">log4j vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the security audit are three (1 Low Risk, 2 Informational) findings, a documented threat model, and a Supply Chain Security review against SLSA. As a result of this review, slf4j, logback, and reload4j (a new fork of log4j 1.x with security fixes) are now reproducible builds, which substantially increases the difficulty of a supply-chain attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All findings identified through this security audit have been fixed and validated. See below for the full report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge thank you to Ceki Gülcü of slf4j for actively participating in the audit process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to </span><a href="https://openssf.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenSSF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for supporting the work and to Google for funding the audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Everyone around the world depends on OSS, and we would love to do more security audits!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Announcement: </span></p>
<h1><b>Google is partnering with Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc to sponsor security reviews of critical open source software. </b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is elated to announce that we are planning to improve security of eight open-source projects thanks to support from the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/">Google Open Source Security Team</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This marks a major success in bringing on large corporate donors to support OSTIF’s model of improving open source software through security reviews and source code audits. A focused, well-scoped review by an experienced team can drive significant and long-lasting improvements in widely used projects. For example, </span><a href="https://ostif.org/our-audit-of-unbound-dns-by-x41-d-sec-full-results/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF’s end-to-end review of Unbound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open-source Domain Name System (DNS) resolver used in securing websites, resulted in 48 changes that strengthened its security, including finding and patching one Critical, five High, and five Medium severity issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s support will allow OSTIF to launch the Managed Audit Program (MAP), which will expand our in-depth security reviews to even more projects vital to the open source ecosystem. Our initial list of </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oytKuD7UCX6nDXWQMr6ZgYYgap_SH_JVBof5gNrgSxo/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 MAP projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was identified empirically by research <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uahUIUa82J6WetAqtxCM_qgH-YJOagH84AFniIhlAbg">[ 1 ]</a>, <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf">[ 2 ]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00352.pdf">[ 3 ]</a> targeted at identifying the most critical digital infrastructure, and cross-referenced with </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenSSF’s Security Scorecards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prioritize projects within the list. Together, these efforts identified eight libraries, frameworks and apps that would benefit the most from security improvements and make the largest impact on the open-source ecosystem that relies on them. </span></p>
<h2><b>The Projects</b></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Git</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is the de facto version control software used in modern DevOps. According to the </span><a href="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/ossf-criticality-score/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Git is the second-most critical application in C and the 10th-most critical application across all platforms. In development since 2005, git makes up the foundation of </span><a href="https://github.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">github</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gitlab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is undoubtedly one of the most critical pieces of open-source software in the world. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lodash</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>, a modern JavaScript utility library with over 200 functions to facilitate web development, can be found in most environments that support JavaScript, which is most of the world wide web. Lodash is also used and tested in most current web browsers, including Chrome since v74. Lodash was chosen for security review due to ubiquity and project age, along with a relatively high </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 77%. The Linux Foundation &amp; The Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard’s study titled </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identified lodash as one of the most used packages according to dependency analysis. Furthermore, taking into account at least </span><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=20100&amp;product_id=57083&amp;version_id=0&amp;page=1&amp;hasexp=0&amp;opdos=0&amp;opec=0&amp;opov=0&amp;opcsrf=0&amp;opgpriv=0&amp;opsqli=0&amp;opxss=0&amp;opdirt=0&amp;opmemc=0&amp;ophttprs=0&amp;opbyp=0&amp;opfileinc=0&amp;opginf=0&amp;cvssscoremin=0&amp;cvssscoremax=0&amp;year=0&amp;cweid=0&amp;order=1&amp;trc=4&amp;sha=ec99d3827329b3d01f3412ca337b0d88dfbde6dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 reported vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 2018 and a </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 50%, it is reasonable to justify a Security Review and a boost to security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laravel</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> is a php web application framework that is used by many modern, full-stack web applications, including integrations with Google Cloud. Laravel was chosen for security review due to ubiquity and project age along with a relatively high </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 79%. Laravel has at least 9 reported vulnerabilities since 2017 and a </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 58%, making it a good candidate for Security Review and a boost to security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slf4j</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">Slf4j</a> is a logging facade for various Java logging frameworks. </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identified slf4j as one of most-used non-JavaScript packages according to dependency analysis. Factoring in the project age of 16 years and various vulnerability reports, such as </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8088"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CVE-2018-0088</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a detailed review would likely provide substantial improvement to its security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson-core &amp; Jackson-databind</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core">Jackson-core</a> is a JSON for Java, Streaming API, and extra shared components and the base the </span><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson data-bind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> package. Both projects were identified by </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the 1st and 2nd most-used non-JavaScript packages. With project ages of over 9 years and </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 42% and 58% respectively, it is reasonable to justify a review and a boost to security posture for these widely-used dependencies.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Httpcomponents-core &amp; Httpcomponents-client</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core and client components of <a href="https://hc.apache.org/">Apache httpcomponents</a>, these projects are responsible for creating and maintaining a toolset of low-level Java components focused on HTTP and associated protocols. Fundamental functions of the web, these projects were identified in the most widely used non-javascript packages. </span></p>

<h2><b>Thank You</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to thank the Google Open Source Security Team for helping us scale our impact to not only find bugs but also fix issues across the open-source ecosystem. From here, we hope to significantly grow operations to support hundreds of projects in the coming few years. To reach this goal, we will need support from the communities that rely on this infrastructure, and improve our data to target the best projects for our work. In the end, we believe these combined efforts will lead to a safer open source environment for everyone.</span></p>
