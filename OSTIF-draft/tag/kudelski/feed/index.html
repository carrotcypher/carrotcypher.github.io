Bulletproofs is a trustless proofs setup that is substantially smaller than the current Borromean style range proofs that are currently used, promising to make Monero transactions 10-20% of their current size.</p>
<p>Kudelski found that the code was largely clean and that the C implementation that Monero has developed from the original Java code is suitable for use. Their findings did include 4 low severity bugs that have been patched, as well as a number of informational issues.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The bugs that were fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-001: Unsafe use of environment variables</span><br />
Patch: This function no longer uses environment variables to set this value, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in commit 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-002: Lack of input validation in prover</span><br />
Patch: Input scalars are now checked to ensure they are within the proper range in the prove and verify routines, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-003: Integer overflow in bulletproof L size computation</span><br />
Patch: Correct boundary checks have been added to avoid the overflow, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in commit 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-O-008: Undefined behavior shifting signed value</span><br />
Patch: The function has been rewritten using a ternary operator in <span style="color: #28cc57;">commit 68f7606</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with updates to the bulletproofs code which fixes all of the high priority concerns.</p>
<p>This is the first of two audits that are sponsored by <a href="https://lab.getmonero.org/">Monero Research Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/">The Monero Community</a>, <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>, and <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a>. The second audit of Bulletproofs is being done by <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/en/">QuarksLab</a> and the results will be released in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Double Your Donations With CrowdRise</h1>
<p>Today, we begin our second round of funding in partnership with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, who will be matching Crowdrise donations for the next four weeks!</p>
<p>You can view the Crowdrise campaign and donate here to have your donation matched (doubled): <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/">https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/</a></p>
<h2>OpenSSL 1.1.1 Project Changes</h2>
<p>We have made changes to the proposed OpenSSL project to bring down costs while still allocating enough resources to ensure that a complete and thorough audit is completed.</p>
<p>The original plan was for all OpenSSL components in the scope to be reviewed by two separate teams, one at Kudelski and one at QuarksLab. This was costly and redundant work that greatly inflated the cost of the project and has delayed fundraising and completion.</p>
<p>To trim down costs, we have:</p>
<p>-Removed Kudelski as our secondary auditor (they were the higher of the two bids).</p>
<p>-Added Jean-Phillipe Aumasson specifically to review the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) changes.</p>
<p>-Removed overhead costs such as t-shirts and other giveaways that greatly inflate the costs of the fundraising.</p>
<p>These changes reduced our overall cost of the project substantially and our project fundraising goal is <strong>LESS THAN HALF</strong> of what it was originally.</p>
<p>We now only need to raise a total of $150,000 to meet our goal and fully fund the project. We are already over halfway there!</p>
<p>The goal on CrowdRise ($70000) represents the funds that we need to raise to complete the OpenSSL project.</p>
