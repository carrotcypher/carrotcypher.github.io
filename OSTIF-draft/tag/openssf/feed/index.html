Equinox P2 is a provisioning platform, started by IBM in 2001. The Eclipse Foundation was founded three years later to act as an open, non-for-profit leader of the Eclipse Project community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF was contacted by the Foundation, with </span><a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2022/06/20/openssf-funds-python-and-eclipse-foundations-and-acquires-sos-dev-through-alpha-omega-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400">funding from OpenSSF project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, to perform a security audit and provide recommendations for security hardening. With Include Security, the audit resulted in a developed threat model, code review, and analysis of SAST and fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Include Security team followed a static code analysis with white-box code review methodology throughout the engagement. The result was one critical, three medium, and five low-risk findings. For the threat model, the focal point was on feasibly applicable threat actors to PGP-based signature verification. Everything else was considered out of the scope of the audit. In a methodical practice, Include created a threat model of the Target of Evaluation after a four step system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the 22 person days spent on the audit, Include Security also worked on SAST tooling and fuzzing for continuous monitoring. In the report, Include Security offers three security tools and recommendations of how fuzzing and SAST tooling could be reworked to best run on P2’s code. This would be mainly by adding rules to scanners to eliminate noise and false positives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF would like to extend our gratitude to the Equinox P2 team and the Eclipse Foundation for their participation and partnership in this security audit, particularly Mikael Barbero and Marta Rybczynska. Thank you as well to those at Include Security, for their hard work and final report on this project. Finally, we would like to acknowledge and thank OpenSSF </span><a href="https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for their financial support of this critical security work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today OSTIF is thrilled to release the Independent Security Audit Impact Report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This report is the culmination of over a year’s worth of work that OSTIF organized thanks to funding from Google and OpenSSF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am extremely proud of this work and what OSTIF continues to accomplish. Organizations like Google, OpenSSF, and many others are eager to fund initiatives that help secure the open source ecosystem, and I firmly believe that OSTIF is one of the best outlets for doing just that. We were able to take almost $1,000,000 and turn it into significant security improvements to critical projects in one year.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to report the results for the security audits of <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core">Jackson-Core</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind">Jackson-Databind</a>. Jackson-Core and Jackson-Databind are Java projects that are widely adopted for parsing and binding data. The security review was facilitated by <a href="https://ostif.org/">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> backed by the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a> and carried out by <a href="https://adalogics.com/">Adalogics</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. The Jackson team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by requesting independent review and actively participating in the audit process.</p>
<h2>Security Findings</h2>
<p>The results of the security audit are 12 security findings (3 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low/Informational). In addition, the team at Adalogics built 10 new fuzzers (4 for Jackson-core and 6 for Jackson-databind) which led to eight new bugs being discovered. These fuzzers will run on ossfuzz for Jackson before every release, giving Jackson a long-term security benefit.</p>
<p>The two most notable issues are <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42003">CVE-2022-42003</a> and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42004">CVE-2022-42004</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-42003 Resource Exhaustion via UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS</strong></p>
<p>An unchecked deserializer could be abused to exhaust resources via nesting arrays, causing a denial of service.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-42004 Resource Exhaustion via BeanDeserializer._deserializeFromArray</strong></p>
<p>An unchecked deserializer could be abused to exhaust resources via nesting arrays, causing a denial of service. This bug has a more limited impact because it requires specific settings to be manually enabled in order to be exploitable.</p>
<p>The remaining high severity issue was an edge case that Adalogics and the Jackson team assessed has no use cases that are exploitable.</p>
<p>All of the serious issues identified through this engagement have been fixed and validated by the Adalogics team. See below for the full report.</p>
<h2>Thank You</h2>
<p>A big thank you to the Open Software Security Foundation for supporting the work and funding the audit. Furthermore, thank you to the Adalogics team for executing the audit and working with us to make and validate fixes. Also, thank you to the <a href="https://sos.dev">Secure Open Source</a> initiative for helping to compensate the Jackson team for their extensive work improving these projects.</p>
<p>Also special thanks to Tatu Salorenta, Adam Korczynski, and David Korczynski for their roles in the engagement.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s Do More to Make Open Source Better</h2>
<p>Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Everyone around the world depends on OSS, and we would love to do more security audits! If you’re interested in financially supporting this work, contact <a href="mailto:amir@ostif.org">amir@ostif.org</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited to report the results of a security audit of </span><a href="https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slf4j</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Simple Logging Facade for Java, slf4j, is identified in the </span><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/tools/census-ii-of-free-and-open-source-software-application-libraries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Census II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results as one of the most widely-deployed logging frameworks. The security and supply chain review was facilitated by </span><a href="https://ostif.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and carried out by </span><a href="https://includesecurity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. Upon review, it was found that slf4j has a very small attack surface area and does not support post-processing of logging messages that may be cause for security concern, such as the </span><a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">log4j vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the security audit are three (1 Low Risk, 2 Informational) findings, a documented threat model, and a Supply Chain Security review against SLSA. As a result of this review, slf4j, logback, and reload4j (a new fork of log4j 1.x with security fixes) are now reproducible builds, which substantially increases the difficulty of a supply-chain attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All findings identified through this security audit have been fixed and validated. See below for the full report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge thank you to Ceki Gülcü of slf4j for actively participating in the audit process. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OSTIF has been working with the <a href="https://openssf.org/">Open Source Security Foundation&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-critical-projects">Securing Critical Projects working group</a> to help identify critical pieces of infrastructure that require focused security attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony">Symfony</a>, a widely used PHP framework has consistently been near the top of multiple reports, underscoring the criticality of the project to the open source community. It also appears on the OSTIF <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oytKuD7UCX6nDXWQMr6ZgYYgap_SH_JVBof5gNrgSxo">Managed Audit Program 25</a>, a doc that pulls data from multiple sources to develop a high priority list of projects to consider for security review and free consulting.</p>
<p>When the opportunity for a grant arose, OSTIF hand picked Symfony as the project of choice for the proposed budget. Symfony represents a cross-section of criticality, complexity, and visible security practices that make the project an ideal candidate for benefiting from our free auditing services. The OpenSSF technical advisory committee, the governing board, and the budget committee all approved the project, which gives OSTIF another exciting opportunity to showcase the value of our work to the world.</p>
<p>As this project progresses, we will work with our security teams to create the most effective scope for the budget that we have, work with the project maintainers to set up clear communication and to share their any concerns that they have about components or areas of code that they might find problematic, and guide them through the audit process and resolution.</p>
<p>When the project completes, we will post the results here, and on multiple services that aggregate audit information for easy access.</p>
