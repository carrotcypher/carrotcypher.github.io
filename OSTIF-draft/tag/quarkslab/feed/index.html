										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falco joins a </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/03/13/an-overview-of-the-cncf-and-ostif-impact-report-for-the-second-half-of-2022-and-early-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing number of CNCF Projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that completed a third-party security audit organized by OSTIF. A follow up to their </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/audits/SECURITY_AUDIT_2019_07.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Falco project requested a new engagement due to changes in the code base since. OSTIF partnered with </span><a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarkslab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to complete the audit. An overview of the results along with a link to the report can be found below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Security audits are a good practice for projects especially as their communities and users grow. The <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/05/18/cloud-native-maturity-model-2-0/">CNCF maturity model</a> is a good example of using policy and a strong support network to help projects improve their security posture. It’s an especially good practice to do follow-on audits as projects implement new code and features. I commend the Falco team for their efforts and commitment.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director of OSTIF. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Falco community is composed of information security experts that are passionate and committed to making all aspects of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secure as possible at every level. It has been a pleasure working with OSTIF and Quarkslab to not only assess the current level of security but to also design the most effective strategies to continuously verify and improve the security properties of the project. We are especially impressed by the depth and quality of the analysis performed and the clear and smooth communication </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luca Guerra, Falco Core Maintainer, Open Source Engineer at Sysdig</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As found in the report, “The goal of the audit was to assist the Falco maintainers to increase their security posture using static and dynamic analysis. Falco maintainers required an emphasis on fuzzing. To that end, Quarkslab’s engineers researched multiple topics to provide recommendations and relevant advice. In addition, Quarkslab’s engineers assessed the code in order to find some issues, using automated testing tools, fuzzing, or just by manually reviewing the code base.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engagement included a threat model along with Static and Dynamic analysis and mainly uncovered 1 Medium and a number of low and informational findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reviewing the report findings, Falco maintainers and contributors worked to address all the issues identified, enhance static and dynamic analysis pipelines and track longer term tasks. The overall goal is to establish continuous improvement projects to maintain the highest security standards in the codebase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Falco release team that worked on the </span><a href="https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-34-0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34.0 release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-34-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34.1 patch release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on Falco Libraries 0.10.3 and 0.10.4 addressed all medium and low severity findings, along with informational findings as well. Details on the issues, credits, patches and affected versions are tracked in the relevant </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/security/advisories"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repository’s Security Advisories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuously assessing the security of the codebase and making sure that potential weak points are caught and fixed early in the development process is extremely important for Falco maintainers and contributors; according to the report recommendations the static and dynamic analysis steps automatically performed have been enhanced, with more additions planned. For instance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/93ae6bb6098e7563f94738839715c2d7ee8f5ab5/.github/workflows/staticanalysis.yaml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CppCheck has been added</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Falco repository alongside other static analysis tools already present;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/master/semgrep"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semgrep has been added</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Falco Libs repository to prevent potentially dangerous functions from being introduced by contributors and enable more security focused checks in the future;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of AddressSanitizer, LeakSanitizer and similar tools </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/blob/33b2337c384b608049c8d619698396bd706ad98b/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L283"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been extended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to end to end testing to further improve memory leak, memory corruption, and error detection.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Falco community is also </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/issues/979"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new ideas for more ways to integrate additional static analysis, memory leak, and memory error detection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falco maintainers have also greatly appreciated the work that the Quarkslab team has done on fuzzing and dynamic analysis. The report reveals that building a robust fuzzer for Falco is a challenging task, and the Falco community intends to work on it based on the expertise shared in the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank Leonardo Grasso, Jason Dellaluce, Luca Guerra, and the rest of the Falco team for contributing time to collaborate with the audit team. Furthermore a big thank you to Mahé Tardy, Laurent Laubin, Victor Houal, and Ramtine Tofighi Shirazi for their diligent work.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We would like to thank our sponsors <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></span> and <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></span> for helping to fund this security review, as well as all of our  donors and individual supporters. This crucial work doesn’t happen without support from the community.</p>
<h2>The quick and dirty:</h2>
<p>OpenSSL version 1.1.1 was evaluated with special foci on new TLS 1.3 features and changes made to the Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). The PRNG review was conducted by Dr JP Aumasson and Antony Vennard with a follow-up review by the QuarksLab team. The general review was for all new code in OpenSSL 1.1.1 with a focus on TLS 1.3 and the changed PRNG.</p>
<p>QuarksLab found a number of small issues, all of which were resolved before the public release of OpenSSL version 1.1.1. Issues one and two would have led to <em>client-side denial-of-service vulnerabilities</em>, where a malicious man-in-the-middle could cause OpenSSL to crash by sending invalid information.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1:</strong> In some situations a connection could fail without an alert being sent. <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6852">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6852</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Issue 2:</strong> Multiple issues with TLS v1.3 alerts. <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6887">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6887</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Issue 3: New PRNG</strong> – The new pseudorandom number generator in OpenSSL does follow the NIST standard implementation SP800-90A, but the code quality could improve, with better comments and more clearly defined functions. (Note: The version of the code reviewed was after the improvements made that were <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://ostif.org/our-review-of-the-openssl-1-1-1-random-number-generation-update/">recommended by our other team, led by JP Aumasson</a></span>.)</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4: SRP Authentication Protocol</strong> – The SRP auth protocol is correctly implemented, but the code quality could improve, with better comments and more clearly defined functions. Also, SRP lacked some return value checks that would ensure that values are in an expected state. This was improved with <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8019"><span style="color: #289dcc;">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8019</span></a> The specific commit is here: <a href="https://github.com/liqifyl/openssl-image/commit/495a1e5c3aec4d44558cd86161b8385f1b1b6822"><span style="color: #289dcc;">https://github.com/liqifyl/openssl-image/commit/495a1e5c3aec4d44558cd86161b8385f1b1b6822</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Issue 5: CAPI</strong> – The code lacks comments, making the implementation hard to follow and understand. Other than these best practices issues, the code is well written and no problems were found.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 6: Global Lack of NULL Checks</strong> – The QuarksLab team recommended that null checks be present in many of the internal functions of OpenSSL, as a null value being passed where it is not expected by the software leads to unpredictable behavior that can lead to security or stability problems.</p>
<p>The OpenSSL development team intentionally omits null checks for performance reasons, and further notes that there no known ways to pass null values in OpenSSL <em>that lead to vulnerabilities</em>.</p>
<p>OSTIF consulted two other security experts regarding this issue, and both agreed that while null checks can be a best practice for a defense-in-depth code strategy, it is unlikely that a vulnerability from a lack of null checks will surface unless it is portions of the code that can be called remotely.</p>
<p>This is a small best practices issue that does not cause any known vulnerability or problem, and the expert opinions on the real impact differ, and the OpenSSL team did not patch.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>OpenSSL has successfully transitioned to TLS 1.3 without any serious security problems that we’ve found. The code quality and comments could stand to be improved in areas, but the code is functional, secure, and fast. The OpenSSL security team was fantastic throughout the entire process, assisting us with questions and quickly responding to concerns that were raised as we found them.</p>
<p>Our work on OpenSSL has led to a total of 16 recommendations and changes in OpenSSL, and we will be adding OpenSSL to our bug bounty program for version 1.1.1a and later through our partnership with the <a href="https://internetbugbounty.org/"><span style="color: #289dcc;">Internet Bug Bounty</span></a> on <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/"><span style="color: #289dcc;">HackerOne</span></a>.</p>

Bulletproofs are a trustless proofs setup that are substantially smaller than the current Borromean style range proofs that were previously used, which reduces the size of Monero transactions by 80-90%.</p>
<p>Monero’s latest network update, which is now live, has enabled Bulletproofs and corrected all outstanding issues that were raised by the Kudelski and QuarksLab projects.</p>
<p><strong>QuarksLab found:</strong><br />
8 <span style="color: #cc284b;">Critical</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
2 <span style="color: #cca928;">Medium</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
20 <span style="color: #28cc57;">Low</span> or <span style="color: #28cc57;">Informational</span> Vulnerabilities / Concerns / Recommendations</p>
<hr />
<h4><span style="color: #cc284b;">One live-chain critical flaw identified and fixed:</span></h4>
<p>QuarksLab found a denial of service vulnerability that could allow an attacker to <strong>arbitrarily crash Monero nodes remotely</strong>, creating a vulnerability for a large-scale denial of service campaign for the Monero network and further potentially leading to a 51% attack and forced chain split, ultimately leading to double-spends.</p>
<p>Because this flaw impacted live code, OSTIF, QuarksLab, and the Monero team agreed to a disclosure embargo on this report until after the latest network upgrade that forced users to upgrade their nodes to patched code. The Monero XMR network is now safe from this flaw.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other serious bugs that were identified and fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>A lack of null value checks in the Bulletproofs proving algorithm.</em></span> The bulletproofs code relies on values being passed to it not being null, but did not proactively ensure that null values cannot be passed or checked for.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Dependent Generators in original java version of Bulletproofs are not secure.</em></span> The code had to be revised to improve number generation.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Overflow in double scalar multiplication.</em></span> The code needed to be patched to prevent the overflow of data.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Erroneous identity output in Bos-Coster multi-exponentiation.</em></span> The structure of the code could select the wrong input and return incorrect values.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Silently discarded element in Pippenger multi-exponentiation.</em></span> An optimization designed to discard large numbers of leading zeros could return the identity if a value of x^0 was entered into the function, meaning that the operation can return the identity unmodified. The optimization also had the additional issue of possibly discarding critical values for exact powers of two as inputs.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Invalid Verify input parameters.</em></span> There are no checks that the points provided are indeed points of Ed25519 and that they are on the main subgroup.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Key compromise in Schnorr signature.</em></span> In order to generate a valid Schnorr signature, the value k cannot be null or zero. If the value is null, an attacker can detect this and know the value of the key used to sign. If the value k is zero, then the value of the result is independent of the key and invalid. Checks needed to be added to the Schnorr signature to verify that the value k is not null or zero.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Failures in input size validation during (de)serialization.</em></span> A serialization error could allow an attacker to allocate up to 4GB of memory by initializing a value of 0 for nbp. Consequently, this can lead to memory being allocated for partially completed containers.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Failures in input type validation during (de)serialization.</em></span> A lack of robust checking for input type error from untrusted sources can lead to undesired behavior and error states.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Twenty other recommendations to improve security, robustness, practices, and performance.</em></span> The team also made a number of recommendations to code practices to improve the robustness of Monero code, to optimize performance, to improve error handling, and to reduce the attack surface of the software.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the second of two audits that were conducted for Monero Bulletproofs. The first audit of Bulletproofs was conducted by Kudelski Security and the results <a href="https://ostif.org/the-quarkslab-and-kudelski-security-audits-of-monero-bulletproofs-are-complete/">are here</a>.</p>

Bulletproofs is a trustless proofs setup that is substantially smaller than the current Borromean style range proofs that are currently used, promising to make Monero transactions 10-20% of their current size.</p>
<p>Kudelski found that the code was largely clean and that the C implementation that Monero has developed from the original Java code is suitable for use. Their findings did include 4 low severity bugs that have been patched, as well as a number of informational issues.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The bugs that were fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-001: Unsafe use of environment variables</span><br />
Patch: This function no longer uses environment variables to set this value, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in commit 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-002: Lack of input validation in prover</span><br />
Patch: Input scalars are now checked to ensure they are within the proper range in the prove and verify routines, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-003: Integer overflow in bulletproof L size computation</span><br />
Patch: Correct boundary checks have been added to avoid the overflow, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in commit 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-O-008: Undefined behavior shifting signed value</span><br />
Patch: The function has been rewritten using a ternary operator in <span style="color: #28cc57;">commit 68f7606</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with updates to the bulletproofs code which fixes all of the high priority concerns.</p>
<p>This is the first of two audits that are sponsored by <a href="https://lab.getmonero.org/">Monero Research Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/">The Monero Community</a>, <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>, and <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a>. The second audit of Bulletproofs is being done by <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/en/">QuarksLab</a> and the results will be released in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Double Your Donations With CrowdRise</h1>
<p>Today, we begin our second round of funding in partnership with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, who will be matching Crowdrise donations for the next four weeks!</p>
<p>You can view the Crowdrise campaign and donate here to have your donation matched (doubled): <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/">https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/</a></p>
<h2>OpenSSL 1.1.1 Project Changes</h2>
<p>We have made changes to the proposed OpenSSL project to bring down costs while still allocating enough resources to ensure that a complete and thorough audit is completed.</p>
<p>The original plan was for all OpenSSL components in the scope to be reviewed by two separate teams, one at Kudelski and one at QuarksLab. This was costly and redundant work that greatly inflated the cost of the project and has delayed fundraising and completion.</p>
<p>To trim down costs, we have:</p>
<p>-Removed Kudelski as our secondary auditor (they were the higher of the two bids).</p>
<p>-Added Jean-Phillipe Aumasson specifically to review the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) changes.</p>
<p>-Removed overhead costs such as t-shirts and other giveaways that greatly inflate the costs of the fundraising.</p>
<p>These changes reduced our overall cost of the project substantially and our project fundraising goal is <strong>LESS THAN HALF</strong> of what it was originally.</p>
<p>We now only need to raise a total of $150,000 to meet our goal and fully fund the project. We are already over halfway there!</p>
<p>The goal on CrowdRise ($70000) represents the funds that we need to raise to complete the OpenSSL project.</p>

<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with the release of OpenVPN 2.4.2 which fixes all of the high priority concerns.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Fixes:</strong></h2>
<p>Because of this audit, the OpenVPN development team has issued a number of fixes in OpenVPN 2.4.2.</p>
<p><strong>The fixes include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of a pre-authentication Denial of Service attack</em>.</span> An attacker can crash any OpenVPN client or server without any credentials or keys.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of an authenticated user Denial of Service attack</em>.</span> An attacker can crash an OpenVPN client or server using an AEAD mode cipher by sending crafted data to exhaust the packet counter. Requires authentication.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of issues in mbedtls (PolarSSL) X509 certificate handling.</em></span> Verify return values of mbedtls_x509_dn_gets and mbedtls_x509_serial_gets correctly.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of usernames and passwords not being properly erased.</em></span> for the new bootloader. (keystrokes not erased after authentication)</li>
<li><em><span style="color: #cc284b;">Correction of null pointer dereferences.</span> </em><em>Because this issue is low-severity and not exploitable, this fix is reserved for a future release.</em></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of service handling for OpenVPN GUI.</em></span> The OpenVPN GUI did not properly terminate the service when closed.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Improvements to documentation of the OpenVPN protocol.</em></span> Improving transparency of functionality for developers working with the OpenVPN protocol.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Updates to user documentation for other vulnerabilities that can be closed by user practices</em>.</span> Such as selecting more secure options, and deprecating antiquated options that are unsafe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Furthermore the following was affirmed:<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When using OpenSSL, OpenVPN uses the<strong> RAND_bytes </strong>function for entropy exclusively. It appears to utilize it correctly with proper error handling.</li>
<li>When using mbedTLS, OpenVPN uses the <strong>mbedtls_ctr_drbg_random</strong> function for entropy exclusively. It appears to utilize it correctly with proper error handling.</li>
<li>When generating “non critical” random values, OpenVPN uses a custom algorithm that is <strong>non-standard but cryptographically sound</strong>.</li>
<li>OpenVPN contains some legacy code related to end-of-life versions of OpenSSL that are no longer supported.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The full audit report can be accessed below, <strong>please do not direct link to the audit report, as we would like visitors to see our synopsis and donation links before viewing the full audit</strong>. Thank you.</p>

<p>There was also another security review performed by Dr Matthew Green at Cryptography Engineering paid for by Private Internet Access. You can access this security evaluation here:</p>
<p><span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/05/openvpn-2-4-evaluation-summary-and-report/">https://privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/05/openvpn-2-4-evaluation-summary-and-report/</a></span></p>
<p>Cryptography Engineering focused on the cryptography aspects of OpenVPN, and gave a list of recommended changes to improve the general cryptographic strength of OpenVPN.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Correction of authentication token handling in TLS auth while in an error state.</span> This has a commit in the 2.4 branch and will be fixed in a future release. It is low-impact.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Potential loss of privacy with TLS auth or TLS crypt IV collision.</span> The OpenVPN team is updating documentation and disagrees with the wording of a “total loss of privacy”. These functions protect already encrypted data with a second layer of encryption.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of the –no-IV option.</span> The OpenVPN team has slated this option for deprecation and will be eliminated entirely in OpenVPN 2.5 and later.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of the –no-replay option.</span> The OpenVPN team has stated that this feature is for debugging only, and should not be used outside of that context.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of the –reneg-bytes option.</span> The OpenVPN team has stated that this will break configurations of OpenVPN that use One Time Pads, and needs to be left in for compatibility.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Increase the strength of default encryption options.</span> OpenVPN 2.4 and greater has stronger defaults in that cipher negotiation is used and defaults to AES-256-GCM, while also allowing stronger future ciphers to be supported provided that both the client and server support it.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Warn about insecure modes of operation.</span> OpenVPN will now issue a serious warning when –cipher none or –auth none is used.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Remove system() from sample authentication plugin.</span> There is a commit for this fix ready for a future release, likely for 2.4.3 or 2.4.4.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of –script-security 3.</span> The OpenVPN team disagrees with the severity of the safety risks in the recommendation. The command will remain as-is, possibly with a documentation change.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of –tls-verify due to non-specific vulnerability.</span> The OpenVPN team failed to find any issues with the current implementation.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Warn users about compression use.</span> As of 2.4.3 and higher, users will be warned about the risks of combining compression with streamed data.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>The Fixes:</strong></h2>
<p>Because of this audit, VeraCrypt has issued a number of fixes to both the application and the bootloader in 1.19.</p>
<p><strong>The fixes include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Removal of the GOST 28147-89 encryption option entirely</em>.</span> The implementation was unsafe. Functionality for decryption of volumes that used this cipher is still in place, but new volumes cannot be created using this cipher.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Removal of XZip and XUnzip</em>.</span> These were replaced with modern and more secure zip libraries (libzip).</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/?p=492">OSTIF + QuarksLab Audit of VeraCrypt Completed &#8211; Phase II Begins</a></h1>
<p>The audit of VeraCrypt has been completed, and the final report is being created over the coming days. The VeraCrypt developers have the preliminary results and we are working with both VeraCrypt and QuarksLab on the timetable for releasing results.</p>
<h2>Why aren&#8217;t results released immediately?</h2>
<p>In order to ensure that the public is as safe as possible, public release of the audit information is not released until the developers of the software are confident that all bugs are fixed. This delay is to ensure that an updated version of the software is available simultaneously with the release of the audit results.</p>
<p>It is also OSTIF policy that we do not handle &#8220;zero day&#8221; vulnerability information. This both releases us from liability if a zero day were to go public, and allows developers and donors to trust that we are not misusing or selling vulnerability information. The primary purpose of these audits is to improve the security software, and our policies reflect that.</p>
<p>We are working closely with QuarksLab and VeraCrypt to ensure that as soon as VeraCrypt is ready, we will simultaneously release the results of the audit on all three of our websites.</p>
<p>Check this site for updates!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are currently in talks with <a href="http://www.quarkslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quarkslab</a> about possible contracts for getting our supported apps audited.</p>
<p>We have selected Quarkslab as a candidate for multiple reasons. They have a strong team of professional staff that works heavily in the areas of software security auditing and cryptography. They have done public audits of independent software before and their work was deep and detailed. Their work on <a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2015-06-25_chatsecure/14-03-022_ChatSecure-sec-assessment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">auditing the ChatSecure application for iOS</a> was impressive. They found multiple critical vulnerabilities that are subsequently being fixed and improved the platform and the trust in the application. We also selected Quarkslab because they are a French company that is not a member of the 5-eyes surveillance alliance. We believe that if a backdoor into a supported app existed, that backdoor would most likely belong to a 5-eyes nation, and those countries could exert enormous pressure on companies that reside within that state to hide evidence of clandestine activity.</p>
<p><strong>The large, highly skilled staff, their track record with auditing, and their non-affiliation with 5-eyes makes Quarkslab an ideal candidate for us.</strong></p>
<p>Getting our supported apps audited is a primary goal for OSTIF. We strongly believe in the open-source model for security applications and our ultimate goal is to bolster the security and trust in these apps.</p>
