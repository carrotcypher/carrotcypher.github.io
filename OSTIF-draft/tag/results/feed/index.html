										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc is happy to announce the results of the CloudEvents Security Assessment. CloudEvents is a </span><a href="https://cloudevents.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">specification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for describing event data in a common way that simplifies event declaration and delivery across services, platforms, and beyond. CloudEvents has a robust </span><a href="https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/docs/contributors.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network of contributors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and active development as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Security Assessment took place in September 2022, in which a team of two experts conducted a security review, with four person-weeks of effort. A combination of testing was performed, including dynamic and static analysis of the SDKs and manual review of the specification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. The CloudEvents Assessment did not uncover any significant flaws or defects that could impact system confidentiality, integrity, or availability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notable findings in the review were that some of the SDKs were using outdated dependencies that needed critical security updates, leaving some of them with multiple outdated and vulnerable dependencies. This is a common problem in software, and highlights the importance of better dependency management.  The </span><a href="https://deps.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deps.dev</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool provides insight on project dependencies. Furthermore, the CloudEvents Assessment highlighted the need for adding fuzzing tests to SDKs and potentially adding various SDKs to the </span><a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSS-fuzz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party Security Audits are an important tool for improving a project’s security posture. CloudEvents joins a </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/08/08/improving-cncf-security-posture-with-independent-security-audits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long list of projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have undergone audits in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for funding the audit and entrusting OSTIF to manage it. A big thank you to Doug Davis for collaborating with the audit team. Lastly, thank you to </span><a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications#security-reviews"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trail of Bits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for performing the work. </span></p>

This release included a number of new features including non-western developed encryption options, a boot loader that supports UEFI (modern BIOSes), and more.</p>
<p>QuarksLab found:<br />
8 <span style="color: #cc284b;">Critical</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
3 <span style="color: #cca928;">Medium</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
15 <span style="color: #28cc57;">Low</span> or <span style="color: #28cc57;">Informational</span> Vulnerabilities / Concerns</p>
<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with the release of VeraCrypt 1.19 which fixes the vast majority of these high priority concerns. Some of these issues have not been fixed due to high complexity for the proposed fixes, but workarounds have been presented in the documentation for VeraCrypt.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Fixes:</strong></h2>
<p>Because of this audit, VeraCrypt has issued a number of fixes to both the application and the bootloader in 1.19.</p>
<p><strong>The fixes include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Removal of the GOST 28147-89 encryption option entirely</em>.</span> The implementation was unsafe. Functionality for decryption of volumes that used this cipher is still in place, but new volumes cannot be created using this cipher.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Removal of XZip and XUnzip</em>.</span> These were replaced with modern and more secure zip libraries (libzip).</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 5.1</em></span> (password length can be determined in classic bootloader).</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 7.1</em></span> for the new bootloader. (keystrokes not erased after authentication)</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 7.2</em></span> for the new bootloader. (sensitive data not correctly erased)</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 7.3</em></span> for the new bootloader. (memory corruption)</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 7.4</em></span> for the new bootloader. (null pointer, dead code, inconsistent data reads by ConfigRead, bad pointer in EFIGetHandles, null pointer dereference in the graphic library.)</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Updates to user documentation for other vulnerabilities that can be closed by user practices</em>.</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>VeraCrypt is much safer after this audit, and the fixes applied to the software mean that the world is safer when using this software.</h3>
