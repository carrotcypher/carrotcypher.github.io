										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falco joins a </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/03/13/an-overview-of-the-cncf-and-ostif-impact-report-for-the-second-half-of-2022-and-early-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing number of CNCF Projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that completed a third-party security audit organized by OSTIF. A follow up to their </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/audits/SECURITY_AUDIT_2019_07.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Falco project requested a new engagement due to changes in the code base since. OSTIF partnered with </span><a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarkslab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to complete the audit. An overview of the results along with a link to the report can be found below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Security audits are a good practice for projects especially as their communities and users grow. The <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/05/18/cloud-native-maturity-model-2-0/">CNCF maturity model</a> is a good example of using policy and a strong support network to help projects improve their security posture. It’s an especially good practice to do follow-on audits as projects implement new code and features. I commend the Falco team for their efforts and commitment.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director of OSTIF. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Falco community is composed of information security experts that are passionate and committed to making all aspects of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secure as possible at every level. It has been a pleasure working with OSTIF and Quarkslab to not only assess the current level of security but to also design the most effective strategies to continuously verify and improve the security properties of the project. We are especially impressed by the depth and quality of the analysis performed and the clear and smooth communication </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luca Guerra, Falco Core Maintainer, Open Source Engineer at Sysdig</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As found in the report, “The goal of the audit was to assist the Falco maintainers to increase their security posture using static and dynamic analysis. Falco maintainers required an emphasis on fuzzing. To that end, Quarkslab’s engineers researched multiple topics to provide recommendations and relevant advice. In addition, Quarkslab’s engineers assessed the code in order to find some issues, using automated testing tools, fuzzing, or just by manually reviewing the code base.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engagement included a threat model along with Static and Dynamic analysis and mainly uncovered 1 Medium and a number of low and informational findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reviewing the report findings, Falco maintainers and contributors worked to address all the issues identified, enhance static and dynamic analysis pipelines and track longer term tasks. The overall goal is to establish continuous improvement projects to maintain the highest security standards in the codebase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Falco release team that worked on the </span><a href="https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-34-0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34.0 release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-34-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34.1 patch release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on Falco Libraries 0.10.3 and 0.10.4 addressed all medium and low severity findings, along with informational findings as well. Details on the issues, credits, patches and affected versions are tracked in the relevant </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/security/advisories"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repository’s Security Advisories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuously assessing the security of the codebase and making sure that potential weak points are caught and fixed early in the development process is extremely important for Falco maintainers and contributors; according to the report recommendations the static and dynamic analysis steps automatically performed have been enhanced, with more additions planned. For instance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/93ae6bb6098e7563f94738839715c2d7ee8f5ab5/.github/workflows/staticanalysis.yaml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CppCheck has been added</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Falco repository alongside other static analysis tools already present;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/master/semgrep"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semgrep has been added</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Falco Libs repository to prevent potentially dangerous functions from being introduced by contributors and enable more security focused checks in the future;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of AddressSanitizer, LeakSanitizer and similar tools </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/blob/33b2337c384b608049c8d619698396bd706ad98b/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L283"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been extended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to end to end testing to further improve memory leak, memory corruption, and error detection.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Falco community is also </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/issues/979"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new ideas for more ways to integrate additional static analysis, memory leak, and memory error detection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falco maintainers have also greatly appreciated the work that the Quarkslab team has done on fuzzing and dynamic analysis. The report reveals that building a robust fuzzer for Falco is a challenging task, and the Falco community intends to work on it based on the expertise shared in the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank Leonardo Grasso, Jason Dellaluce, Luca Guerra, and the rest of the Falco team for contributing time to collaborate with the audit team. Furthermore a big thank you to Mahé Tardy, Laurent Laubin, Victor Houal, and Ramtine Tofighi Shirazi for their diligent work.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to report the results for the security audits of <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core">Jackson-Core</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind">Jackson-Databind</a>. Jackson-Core and Jackson-Databind are Java projects that are widely adopted for parsing and binding data. The security review was facilitated by <a href="https://ostif.org/">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> backed by the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a> and carried out by <a href="https://adalogics.com/">Adalogics</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. The Jackson team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by requesting independent review and actively participating in the audit process.</p>
<h2>Security Findings</h2>
<p>The results of the security audit are 12 security findings (3 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low/Informational). In addition, the team at Adalogics built 10 new fuzzers (4 for Jackson-core and 6 for Jackson-databind) which led to eight new bugs being discovered. These fuzzers will run on ossfuzz for Jackson before every release, giving Jackson a long-term security benefit.</p>
<p>The two most notable issues are <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42003">CVE-2022-42003</a> and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42004">CVE-2022-42004</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-42003 Resource Exhaustion via UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS</strong></p>
<p>An unchecked deserializer could be abused to exhaust resources via nesting arrays, causing a denial of service.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-42004 Resource Exhaustion via BeanDeserializer._deserializeFromArray</strong></p>
<p>An unchecked deserializer could be abused to exhaust resources via nesting arrays, causing a denial of service. This bug has a more limited impact because it requires specific settings to be manually enabled in order to be exploitable.</p>
<p>The remaining high severity issue was an edge case that Adalogics and the Jackson team assessed has no use cases that are exploitable.</p>
<p>All of the serious issues identified through this engagement have been fixed and validated by the Adalogics team. See below for the full report.</p>
<h2>Thank You</h2>
<p>A big thank you to the Open Software Security Foundation for supporting the work and funding the audit. Furthermore, thank you to the Adalogics team for executing the audit and working with us to make and validate fixes. Also, thank you to the <a href="https://sos.dev">Secure Open Source</a> initiative for helping to compensate the Jackson team for their extensive work improving these projects.</p>
<p>Also special thanks to Tatu Salorenta, Adam Korczynski, and David Korczynski for their roles in the engagement.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s Do More to Make Open Source Better</h2>
<p>Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Everyone around the world depends on OSS, and we would love to do more security audits! If you’re interested in financially supporting this work, contact <a href="mailto:amir@ostif.org">amir@ostif.org</a>.</p>
