The multi-phased engagement, sponsored by Google, focused first on the triaging and closing of bugs, then upon further improving the core fuzzers that continually monitor for security issues using OSS-Fuzz infrastructure at </span><a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz."><span style="font-weight: 400">https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> This engagement is part of a series of security efforts to improve the security and reliability of Envoy. Earlier efforts include the </span><a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_envoy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">2018 Audit of Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by </span><a href="https://cure53.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cure53</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ada Logics</span></a> <a href="https://blog.envoyproxy.io/a-stroll-down-fuzzer-optimisation-lane-and-why-instrumentation-policies-matter-f0012ec260b3"><span style="font-weight: 400">fuzzing infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> work</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase I of the engagement was designed to help the Envoy Team reduce the number of open bugs identified, reduce noise in the existing fuzzers (so the Envoy team spends less time triaging non-issues), and improve fuzzing coverage where possible. OSTIF sourced four senior security experts from X41 D-sec to complete the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result of Phase I was the fixing of 68 security bugs. Furthermore, two critical vulnerabilities were found and proactively fixed. At the beginning of the Phase I engagement, there were 76 Total Fuzz Issues. As fixes and improvements were implemented, new fuzz issues were identified for analysis, allowing for further iteration and fine-tuning. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <strong>Figure 1: Total Fuzz Issues vs Fixed at end of Phase I </strong></span><strong>(Sept, 2022)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase II was focused on improving the number of executions/second and high signal to noise ratio produced by the fuzzers. Additionally to triaging remaining open high priority fuzzers from Phase I, there was an effort to close another 10 health check related fuzz issues. In order to cover more code faster, while remaining highly efficient and controlling output, X41 was able to analyze bugs from the first phase to determine how the fuzzers were running tests and where they were losing speed and validity. Of Envoy’s original 67 fuzzers, 19 were considered high priority due </span><span style="font-weight: 400">to testing code paths that are exposed to potential attack vectors; by dataplane traffic in the form of QoDs and bugs that can impact reliability and security of Envoy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Because Envoy is also offered as a service, fuzz testing and hardening the configuration interface is crucial.  When fuzzers work on data and configurations simultaneously, there can be a tendency for them to move away from configurations that need deeper testing. This results in less code coverage. Envoy’s code base uses debug assertions, which further slowed down the testing process and often returned noise. To combat and remediate these multiple consequences, X41’s team developed a plan. First, create a way to generate valid configuration files by introspecting the configuration description already augmented by expressions supplying context, and then develop a two-step fuzzing process with the configuration files generated then used for fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The team of Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild and Dr. Robert Femmer had to develop a way to address the set of points they identified as limiting the fuzzers functionality. They aimed to improve the critical fuzzers that run on HTTP decoders and stream management, specifically HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and the HTTP/3 codec interfaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Vehreschild and Dr. Femmer not only developed four new fuzzers, but improved the overall security testing environment of Envoy instrumentally. The created fuzzers targeted HTTP decoders for high throughput focused on primary attack surfaces of Http1 (Balsa and http_parser), Http2 (nghttp2 and oghttp2), and Http3 Quic. To address the issues around configuration files, the team experimented with running configurations repeatedly to explore the data plane deeper before generating another configuration. Configurations found could increase fuzzing speed by a factor of 4 to 20 times. Further work resulted in removing debug assertions and reducing the binary size of fuzzers by a factor of 1.5. By developing ways to create valid and long-running configurations across the configuration and data planes, the performance of fuzzers was increased by a factor of 40. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The graph below strongly suggests that, since </span>March 2022<span style="font-weight: 400"> when Phase I of the engagement began, there has been a downward trend in generation of new fuzz issues due to this collective effort. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work took months to complete and was an open discussion-based project that allowed for all members to collaborate, help each other, and discuss the possibilities and testing done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We sincerely thank Kirtimaan Rajshiva, Adi Peleg, Yan Avlasov, Harvey Tuch, Joshua Marantz, and the entire Envoy Platform Team for funding and guiding this effort along with Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild, Dr. Robert Femmer, and Sofie Seuren of X41 D-Sec for their diligent work and insight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate and improve security posture for the betterment of FOSS. We would also like to recognize Google, without whose funding this project would not have been possible.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is proud to announce the publication of our fourteenth completed audit this year! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In association with </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://theupdateframework.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">go-tuf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OSTIF publishes another FOSS security audit after weeks of hard work and dedication. Go-tuf is used to securely run software update systems in Go as part of </span><a href="https://theupdateframework.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Update Framework</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (“TUF”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main priority of the audit was to review go-tuf’s source code, primarily completed by manual review. Fuzzers were mainly used for preliminary scoping of the source code. It is hypothesized by the X41 team that while it is possible to perform fuzz testing deeper in go-tuf, fuzzing efforts are best focused at detecting irregularities in implementations. During the process of code review performed by X41, one medium, one low, and four unranked vulnerabilities were identified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The medium criticality with two confirmed attack scenarios was classified as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 59, Improper Link Resolution Before File Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which could allow a bad actor to place their own links into the repository. The low severity criticality was architectural, dealing with possible untied updates or metadata. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is grateful to our frequent collaborators, X41 D-sec, for their work and report on go-tuf. Furthermore, we express our gratitude toward the go-tuf team, particularly Joshua Lock and Radoslav Dimitrov. Thank you as well to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their funding and support of this audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback from go-tuf: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the go-tuf community we were happy to see the results of the assessment and the overall quality of the report.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the completion of this audit and more, we hope to encourage further collaboration and successes in the FOSS security space.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s our privilege to announce that OSTIF’s sixth security audit of 2023 is with l</span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libcap/libcap.git/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ibcap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! This was only possible with the fantastic work of </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and generous support of </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libcap is a library for getting and setting POSIX.1e draft 15 capabilities. The 26 year old project is maintained by Andrew G Morgan, a dedicated FOSS community member who was a joy to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identified in the process of this audit were 2 vulnerabilities, one medium (CVE-2023-2603) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and one low (CVE-2023-2602) severity, which guided the customization of multiple fuzz test harnesses for the project. X41 found that the libcap library necessitated the use of AFL++ fuzzing due to the memory corruption vulnerabilities commonly found in C. This was performed in coordination with ASAN (address space sanitizers). The found low severity vulnerability was in fact memory leak related, and the medium had to do with integer overflow on 32bit systems with a specific byte size. These were both addressed before publication of this blog. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would very much like to thank the OSTIF and X41 D-Sec for organizing and completing a thorough and timely audit of the libcap project code. The written audit report is well structured, clear and insightful and I&#8217;m happy that libcap-2.69 has addressed the issues it has uncovered.”  -Andrew G. Morgan</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF would like to thank X41 D-sec for their hard work and perpetual dedication to FOSS security. Their <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/news/2023/05/15/libcap-source-code-audit/">blog can be found here</a> with further details of this project. We extend our gratitude to Amazon Web Services for their sponsorship of this audit and by extension, important security work being performed in open source. </span></p>
