<p><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">X-41 DSec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and OSTIF collaborated in May of 2023 on a source code audit of </span><a href="https://libjpeg-turbo.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">libjpeg-turbo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the accelerated JPEG image decoding software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audit’s emphasis was on reviewing input validation, memory management practices, and analysis of previously reported bugs. Using dynamic, static, and manual code testing, the audit team analyzed and tested libjpeg-turbo’s source code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Documented </span><a href="https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/3.0.0"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are the fixes of all three disclosed vulnerabilities and further changes released on 2023-07-03 with version 3.0.0 of libjpeg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A big thank you to </span><a href="https://github.com/dcommander"><span style="font-weight: 400">DRC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for implementing the fixes. Per the project’s </span><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/libjpeg-turbo"><span style="font-weight: 400">github sponsorship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> page, “libjpeg-turbo is one of the few pieces of critical IT infrastructure that is sustained solely through patronage and funded development.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">X41 noted the libjpeg-turbo library was healthy and following best practices, and recommends further testing on the popular project to minimize and prevent current and future security vulnerabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special thanks to the X-41 team along with </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">AWS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for funding this audit!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is proud to announce the publication of our fourteenth completed audit this year! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In association with </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://theupdateframework.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">go-tuf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OSTIF publishes another FOSS security audit after weeks of hard work and dedication. Go-tuf is used to securely run software update systems in Go as part of </span><a href="https://theupdateframework.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Update Framework</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (“TUF”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main priority of the audit was to review go-tuf’s source code, primarily completed by manual review. Fuzzers were mainly used for preliminary scoping of the source code. It is hypothesized by the X41 team that while it is possible to perform fuzz testing deeper in go-tuf, fuzzing efforts are best focused at detecting irregularities in implementations. During the process of code review performed by X41, one medium, one low, and four unranked vulnerabilities were identified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The medium criticality with two confirmed attack scenarios was classified as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 59, Improper Link Resolution Before File Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which could allow a bad actor to place their own links into the repository. The low severity criticality was architectural, dealing with possible untied updates or metadata. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is grateful to our frequent collaborators, X41 D-sec, for their work and report on go-tuf. Furthermore, we express our gratitude toward the go-tuf team, particularly Joshua Lock and Radoslav Dimitrov. Thank you as well to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their funding and support of this audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback from go-tuf: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the go-tuf community we were happy to see the results of the assessment and the overall quality of the report.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the completion of this audit and more, we hope to encourage further collaboration and successes in the FOSS security space.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In collaboration with </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://in-toto.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-toto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OSTIF is pleased to announce the publication of our audit of in-toto’s source code. In-toto, which has implementations in Python and Go, is a framework software for supply chain security. Integrating security and transparency through the entire process of application, in-toto’s holistic view of supply chain security is admired by us at OSTIF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using manual review (aided with differing static code analyzers for the respective code languages), X41 D-sec team identified 1 High, 4 Medium, and 3 Low severity vulnerabilities. In-toto’s source code is foundationally strong, and reviewed all in-scope code in the designated audit period. Furthermore, X41’s team took measures to help improve the overall security posture of in-toto’s code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the eight vulnerabilities, the most critical could compromise the security chain all the way to final verification. In the Python implementation, multiple vulnerabilities were associated with data verification signed with PGP keys in the layout file imported from GnuPG. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We extend our gratitude to the in-toto team, CNCF for their funding and support of this audit, and especially X-41DSec for their dedication and hard work on this audit. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF,</span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://c-ares.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c-ares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coordinated on a security audit of c-ares’s source code in spring of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C-ares is a library written in C for asynchronous DNS requests, which runs on such applications as Microsoft Windows, Netware, and Android. It was developed at MIT, when a group expanded upon the capabilities of the ares library and licensed c-ares in 1998. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This audit was a well ordered and educational experience for the OSTIF team. While we hope this report will reach those who are able to best benefit from documented FOSS security audits, we know that the work itself will reach all those who depend on c-ares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, X41 found the c-ares library to be well designed and implemented. The audit found six inconsistencies during the process. Three vulnerabilities were rated as medium, three others as informational. Alongside performing static manual code review, the X41 team implemented and customized AFL++ fuzzers during this audit. Recently, AFL++ fuzzers have been made to support command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing, which was important to this audit as c-ares is made up of multiple CLI tooling components in its code base. While the audit particularly focused on memory corruption vulnerabilities which are common in C libraries, two of the medium vulnerabilities were categorized as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 330</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Use of Insufficiently Random Values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so grateful to the c-ares team, particularly their </span><a href="https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/releases"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine contributors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as X41’s fantastic staff for their efforts on this project. </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored this work and we are deeply appreciative of their support of open source security.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Generally speaking, OSTIF as well as the maintainers of the library deserve a lot of praise for their overall support and assistance. It was a pleasure for the testing team working with them.”</strong></span></p>
<p>-from the X41 Team on c-ares</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Results of Git Security Audit</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) is thrilled to announce the results of a security audit and threat model for <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>. Git is the world&#8217;s most widely used version control system, and it underpins not only open source, but the vast majority of public and private software development today. To say that git is infrastructure is an understatement, it reaches nearly every corner of software development and touches nearly every product that has software in one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, git is one of OSTIFs top priorities to help with security resources and has built a large coalition of companies to work on multiple facets of the git project. The security audit conducted by Markus Vervier and Eric Sesterhenn from <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/">X41</a> and Joern Schneeweisz from <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is only a part of the total efforts coordinated by OSTIF. <a href="https://github.com/">Github&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://codeql.github.com/">CodeQL team</a> (thank you Turbo!) is helping the git developers build a custom ruleset for CodeQL to help give the developers more meaningful results and cull false positives so that the tool is more usable than the previous static analysis tools (that the core git team had stopped using due to multiple difficulties). Additionally, Adolfo Veytia and John Speed Meyers from <a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/">Chainguard</a> along with Dennis Appelt from GitLab are working on how the Windows version of git is distributed to make recommendations and changes to improve the supply chain security of git. We will be releasing the results of those efforts as each of these projects is completed. This coalition of efforts is unified through our shared interests in git and the critical role that it plays in the open source world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is extremely grateful for the funding and support from the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/shared-success-in-building-a-safer-open-source-community/">Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST)</a> and the help of the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a> to help make this critical project more secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this portion of the research a total of 35 issues were discovered, including 2 critical severity findings and a high severity finding. Additionally, because of this research, a number of potentially catastrophic security bugs were discovered and resolved internally by the git security team. (A special thank you to Patrick Steinhardt for all of their work on the formatting issues related to CVE-2022-41903).<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The serious bug fixes are in the latest release of Git (released today).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The most notable issues were:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CRITICAL</strong> &#8211; CVE-2022-41903 &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-475x-2q3q-hvwq">Out-of-Bounds Memory Write in Log Formatting</a> (this had multiple collateral issues that were fixed by the git security team that were critical in nature)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CRITICAL</strong> &#8211; CVE-2022-23251 &#8211; Truncated Allocation Leading to Out of Bounds Write Via Large Number of Attributes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>HIGH</strong> &#8211; Out-of-Bounds Read Via Padding Placeholders</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The git team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by actively participating in the audit process and collaborating with the audit team during the initial meetings and security review. We&#8217;d like to thank everyone at git who helped us with this audit, with security tooling questions, and with understanding the git build process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results can be viewed in full detail at the following links:</span></p>

OSTIF is planning many security efforts in 2023, and funding audits like these can be a useful tool for securing projects in open source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to everyone from <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/">X41</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> that did excellent work on this audit!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on this type of security work being done, visit the OSTIF website. <a href="https://github.com/Amir-Montazery/OSTIF/blob/main/Completed-Engagements.md">We also have all of our published work on our Github</a>. Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Everyone around the world depends on open source software (OSS), and security audits play an important role in securing the open source ecosystem.</span></p>
