We expect to meet our goal by years-end if progress continues at this rate. We still have hundreds of companies to contact, talk to about our mission, and reach out to for support.<\/p>\n<p>The community has been instrumental in this effort. Most of the people who want to support our goals reach out to us first. This is because friends and coworkers brought us to their employers attention, and got their company to make contact with us. If you work for a company that benefits greatly from OpenVPN, OpenSSL, GnuPG, OTR Chats, VeraCrypt FDE or containers, or any of our other supported projects, tell your friends and your coworkers. A small discussion can lead to big changes for OSTIF and the speed with which we can get things done.<\/p>\n<p>The faster we complete fundraising and the more support we get, the faster we can move on to the next project and get more work done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ostif.org\/donate\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Support this project by donating!<\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We want to thank everyone who has contributed to us so far in this fundraiser!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/privateinternetaccess.com\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Private Internet Access<\/span><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/mullvad.net\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Mullvad<\/span><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/thatoneprivacysite.net\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">That One Privacy Site<\/span><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/bestvpnrating.com\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">BestVPNRating.com<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We have also had 17 private \/ anonymous donations through various payment platforms.
