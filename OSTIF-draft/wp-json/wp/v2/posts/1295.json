This was costly and redundant work that greatly inflated the cost of the project and has delayed fundraising and completion.<\/p>\n<p>To trim down costs, we have:<\/p>\n<p>-Removed Kudelski as our secondary auditor (they were the higher of the two bids).<\/p>\n<p>-Added Jean-Phillipe Aumasson specifically to review the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) changes.<\/p>\n<p>-Removed overhead costs such as t-shirts and other giveaways that greatly inflate the costs of the fundraising.<\/p>\n<p>These changes reduced our overall cost of the project substantially and our project fundraising goal is <strong>LESS THAN HALF<\/strong> of what it was originally.<\/p>\n<p>We now only need to raise a total of $150,000 to meet our goal and fully fund the project.
