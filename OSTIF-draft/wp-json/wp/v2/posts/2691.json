The sigstore team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by requesting independent review and actively participating in the audit process. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the security audit are three findings (1 High Risk, 2 Low Risk), fuzzing improvements, and a documented threat model.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high-risk finding along with one of the low-risk findings identified through this security audit has been fixed and validated. See below for the full report.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big thank you to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linuxfoundation.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linux Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openssf.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenSSF<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for supporting the work and to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sigstore.dev\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sigstore project<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for funding the audit.
