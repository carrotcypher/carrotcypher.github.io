X41 found that the libcap library necessitated the use of AFL++ fuzzing due to the memory corruption vulnerabilities commonly found in C. This was performed in coordination with ASAN (address space sanitizers). The found low severity vulnerability was in fact memory leak related, and the medium had to do with integer overflow on 32bit systems with a specific byte size. These were both addressed before publication of this blog.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would very much like to thank the OSTIF and X41 D-Sec for organizing and completing a thorough and timely audit of the libcap project code.
