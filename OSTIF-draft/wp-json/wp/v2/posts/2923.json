During this audit Ada Logics ran with a five point list of goals, including manual code review, a threat model, improving Vitess\u2019s fuzzing suite, and a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/slsa.dev\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SLSA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grade.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the moderate vulnerabilities that were reported, two CVEs had the potential to allow malicious users to block other users from using the full capabilities of VTAdmin or Vitess. For example, stopping others from creating shards. Two of the fuzzers created by Ada Logics for Vitess were directly inspired by these two CVEs, and were immediately implemented.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Described further in the report are details of VTAdmin\u2019s attack surface, SLSA compliance, and all 12 vulnerabilities disclosed during the process of the audit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSTIF extends its deep gratitude to Deepthi Sigireddi and the entire Vitess Maintainer team as well as David Korczyzski and Adam Korczynski of Ada Logics.\u00a0 Further thanks to CNCF for their gracious funding of this audit and continued work in open source security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Ada Logics\u2019s blog: <a href=\"https:\/\/adalogics.com\/blog\/vitess-security-audit-2023\">https:\/\/adalogics.com\/blog\/vitess-security-audit-2023<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Vitess\u2019s blog: <a href=\"https:\/\/vitess.io\/blog\/2023-06-05-vitess-security-audit\">https:\/\/vitess.io\/blog\/2023-06-05-vitess-security-audit<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>See the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&#8217;s blog: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/blog\/2023\/06\/05\/vitess-security-audit-results\/\">https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/blog\/2023\/06\/05\/vitess-security-audit-results\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitess Security Audit Full Report: <a href=\"https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/OSTIF-Adalogics-Vitess-Security-Audit-2023.pdf\">https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/OSTIF-Adalogics-Vitess-Security-Audit-2023.pdf<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Security is Vital for Vitess!
