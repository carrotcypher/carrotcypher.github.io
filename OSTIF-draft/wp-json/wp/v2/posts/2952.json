A single high vulnerability identified during the engagement allowed unverified descriptors to be fetched from a remote registry. This was classified as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2023-33959\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CVE-2023-33959<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Such an action could allow a malicious actor to sign or verify an artifact that could fool a user into using a malicious artifact. A solution was devised by using the library to validate descriptors as being provided by the user. Three issues (two medium and one low) were related to signature processing, using endless data attacks to cause resource exhaustion that could lead to denial of service. See <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2023-33957\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CVE-2023-33957<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2023-33958\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CVE-2023-33958<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for more details. The fix for these scenarios was uncomplicated, and can even be modified by users should it be necessary for their use of the library.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The CVEs linked above were issued for three of the seven findings, and the other four received documentation to track them or CLI command flag name changes. These resolutions are in place in subsequent releases including RC-7 and 1.0.0 of Notary.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Notary Project team was eager and reactive to solving reported issues, and as a result their development and release processes were tested and improved.
