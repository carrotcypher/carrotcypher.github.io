We sold our Bitcoins on an exchange on February 26th at an exchange rate of $1202 : 1 BTC, giving us a nice boost over the value of the BTC donations when they were made in November and December 2016.<\/p>\n<p>-Most of the liquidated BTC funds have been moved to the general funds account.<\/p>\n<h2>Future Liabilities:<\/h2>\n<p>-We still need to pay for the OpenVPN audit by QuarksLab upon its conclusion.<\/p>\n<p>-We still need to pay for T-shirt printing related to the OpenVPN fundraiser. While the first rounds of shirts has been printed and shipped, they contain some subtle misprinting errors and will need to be re-printed and re-shipped. The printer has agreed to eat the cost of reprinting the shirts in exchange for us shouldering the cost of the re-shipping.<\/p>\n<p>We are not expecting these liabilities to exceed $66,500 in total costs to OSTIF.<\/p>\n<p>Keep checking with us for more updates!<\/p>\n<p>-Derek<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Open Source Technology Improvement Fund&#8217;s Open Books for 2017 We have been late to the party on updating our open books for 2017.
