										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF,</span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://c-ares.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c-ares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coordinated on a security audit of c-ares’s source code in spring of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C-ares is a library written in C for asynchronous DNS requests, which runs on such applications as Microsoft Windows, Netware, and Android. It was developed at MIT, when a group expanded upon the capabilities of the ares library and licensed c-ares in 1998. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This audit was a well ordered and educational experience for the OSTIF team. While we hope this report will reach those who are able to best benefit from documented FOSS security audits, we know that the work itself will reach all those who depend on c-ares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, X41 found the c-ares library to be well designed and implemented. The audit found six inconsistencies during the process. Three vulnerabilities were rated as medium, three others as informational. Alongside performing static manual code review, the X41 team implemented and customized AFL++ fuzzers during this audit. Recently, AFL++ fuzzers have been made to support command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing, which was important to this audit as c-ares is made up of multiple CLI tooling components in its code base. While the audit particularly focused on memory corruption vulnerabilities which are common in C libraries, two of the medium vulnerabilities were categorized as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 330</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Use of Insufficiently Random Values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so grateful to the c-ares team, particularly their </span><a href="https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/releases"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine contributors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as X41’s fantastic staff for their efforts on this project. </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored this work and we are deeply appreciative of their support of open source security.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Generally speaking, OSTIF as well as the maintainers of the library deserve a lot of praise for their overall support and assistance. It was a pleasure for the testing team working with them.”</strong></span></p>
<p>-from the X41 Team on c-ares</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s our privilege to announce that OSTIF’s sixth security audit of 2023 is with l</span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libcap/libcap.git/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ibcap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! This was only possible with the fantastic work of </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41 D-Sec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and generous support of </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libcap is a library for getting and setting POSIX.1e draft 15 capabilities. The 26 year old project is maintained by Andrew G Morgan, a dedicated FOSS community member who was a joy to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identified in the process of this audit were 2 vulnerabilities, one medium (CVE-2023-2603) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and one low (CVE-2023-2602) severity, which guided the customization of multiple fuzz test harnesses for the project. X41 found that the libcap library necessitated the use of AFL++ fuzzing due to the memory corruption vulnerabilities commonly found in C. This was performed in coordination with ASAN (address space sanitizers). The found low severity vulnerability was in fact memory leak related, and the medium had to do with integer overflow on 32bit systems with a specific byte size. These were both addressed before publication of this blog. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would very much like to thank the OSTIF and X41 D-Sec for organizing and completing a thorough and timely audit of the libcap project code. The written audit report is well structured, clear and insightful and I&#8217;m happy that libcap-2.69 has addressed the issues it has uncovered.”  -Andrew G. Morgan</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF would like to thank X41 D-sec for their hard work and perpetual dedication to FOSS security. Their <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/news/2023/05/15/libcap-source-code-audit/">blog can be found here</a> with further details of this project. We extend our gratitude to Amazon Web Services for their sponsorship of this audit and by extension, important security work being performed in open source. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is pleased to announce that another audit has reached publication! A security audit of simplejson’s source code was conducted in collaboration with X41. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found during the audit process were one medium and two low severity issues, as well as nine more informational issues. In addition, custom differential fuzzing harnesses were made to compare C and Python implementations of simplejson with differential fuzzing across simplejson and orjson to ascertain parsing discrepancies in the two libraries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41’s work in the Python encoder/decoder supported previous security research in simplejson. A mature project like simpejson has many maintainers and contributors over its long life, yet there were still minor fissures in the code that were addressed and patched. The efforts provided by a skilled third-party reviewer can help mature projects further their security concerns and goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank X41 for their continued work with OSTIF in helping open source projects navigate the complex security space. Also, thank you to Amazon Web Services for sponsoring this critically important work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to </span><a href="https://github.com/etrepum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Ippolito</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of simplejson, whose collaboration and openness to working with us made the effort all the more impactful. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many open source projects such as simplejson are developed by volunteers without funding, sponsorship, or dedicated security resources, yet they have become embedded in infrastructure where security is critical. The OSTIF funded security audit of simplejson performed by X41 D-Sec was thorough; it identified potential security issues (minor, in this case) and included several specific recommendations for security hardening that will help the project remain safe to use. Even as a solo maintainer, it was a breeze to work with OSTIF and X41 D-Sec. The entire engagement from their initial email to the release of simplejson v3.9.1 took less than a month, just a few emails and one meeting on my end before receiving the initial report. I&#8217;d highly recommend working with OSTIF to other open source maintainers, and if I was still a decision maker at a corporation I&#8217;d devote resources to sponsoring this important work!” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Amazon Web Services Supports Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director, Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc (OSTIF)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OSTIF team is absolutely thrilled to announce that we’ve reached an agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide $500,000 in funding. The funding from AWS will help OSTIF scale our ability to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical open source projects. In particular, the goal is to improve the sustainability of upstream projects commonly used in the open source ecosystem.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2022 proved to be an impactful year for OSTIF, as we executed over 20 security engagements for critical open source projects; resulting in over 35 Critical/High Vulnerability patches and upwards of 165 total security improvements. Approximately 50 automated security tools, such as fuzzers and CI implementations, were developed to continuously monitor these projects, providing long-term benefits to security posture. The support from AWS will allow us to continue to do that into 2023 and scale our ability to help critical open source projects that everyone depends on.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Amir Montazery, Managing Director, OSTIF</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Creating healthy and sustainable open source communities is the guiding principle behind our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source investments. By sponsoring OSTIF and OpenSSF, we are helping to ensure the long-term security and viability of critical open source software projects that will benefit our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customers, AWS, and the entire information technology ecosystem..&#8221; </span></p>
