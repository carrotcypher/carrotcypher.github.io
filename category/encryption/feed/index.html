										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is working with the Monero community to fund at least two (and probably three) audits of Monero RandomX.</p>
<h2>What is RandomX?</h2>
<p>RandomX is a project that implements a dynamic proof of work algorithm. The aim of an algorithm that changes is to make it difficult to design efficient circuitry that can fully automate the algorithm in an ASIC. The increased complexity of the algorithm makes it so that an ASIC would lose the advantages that it has over more traditional CPU/GPU designs that can execute many types of code and do many types of mathematics.</p>
<p>The goal of RandomX is to be a significant boost to ASIC resistance, which is seen as a hedge against centralization.</p>
<p>Monero (and some other cryptocurrencies) are fighting to overcome significant efforts to centralize mining under ASICs, because one of the fundamental components of cryptocurrency is that access to mining needs to be egalitarian, and custom ASIC designs place the lions&#8217; share of the processing power under the control of a few centralized entities, who then gain significant control over the blockchain.</p>
<p>The community has selected three auditors, and a fourth, <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a>, is also looking at the code through an independent group <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave.org</a>.</p>
<p>The auditors are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/">Kudelski Security</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41 D-Sec</a></p>

<p>You can read the actual proposals from each team here: <a href="https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits">https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits</a></p>
<p>The fundraising has been moving quickly, if you have some XMR that you&#8217;d like to contribute to the effort <a href="https://ccs.getmonero.org/projects/14/donate">you can pitch in here</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We would like to thank our sponsors <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></span> and <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></span> for helping to fund this security review, as well as all of our  donors and individual supporters. This crucial work doesn’t happen without support from the community.</p>
<h2>The quick and dirty:</h2>
<p>OpenSSL version 1.1.1 was evaluated with special foci on new TLS 1.3 features and changes made to the Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). The PRNG review was conducted by Dr JP Aumasson and Antony Vennard with a follow-up review by the QuarksLab team. The general review was for all new code in OpenSSL 1.1.1 with a focus on TLS 1.3 and the changed PRNG.</p>
<p>QuarksLab found a number of small issues, all of which were resolved before the public release of OpenSSL version 1.1.1. Issues one and two would have led to <em>client-side denial-of-service vulnerabilities</em>, where a malicious man-in-the-middle could cause OpenSSL to crash by sending invalid information.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1:</strong> In some situations a connection could fail without an alert being sent. <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6852">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6852</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Issue 2:</strong> Multiple issues with TLS v1.3 alerts. <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6887">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6887</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Issue 3: New PRNG</strong> – The new pseudorandom number generator in OpenSSL does follow the NIST standard implementation SP800-90A, but the code quality could improve, with better comments and more clearly defined functions. (Note: The version of the code reviewed was after the improvements made that were <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://ostif.org/our-review-of-the-openssl-1-1-1-random-number-generation-update/">recommended by our other team, led by JP Aumasson</a></span>.)</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4: SRP Authentication Protocol</strong> – The SRP auth protocol is correctly implemented, but the code quality could improve, with better comments and more clearly defined functions. Also, SRP lacked some return value checks that would ensure that values are in an expected state. This was improved with <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8019"><span style="color: #289dcc;">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8019</span></a> The specific commit is here: <a href="https://github.com/liqifyl/openssl-image/commit/495a1e5c3aec4d44558cd86161b8385f1b1b6822"><span style="color: #289dcc;">https://github.com/liqifyl/openssl-image/commit/495a1e5c3aec4d44558cd86161b8385f1b1b6822</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Issue 5: CAPI</strong> – The code lacks comments, making the implementation hard to follow and understand. Other than these best practices issues, the code is well written and no problems were found.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 6: Global Lack of NULL Checks</strong> – The QuarksLab team recommended that null checks be present in many of the internal functions of OpenSSL, as a null value being passed where it is not expected by the software leads to unpredictable behavior that can lead to security or stability problems.</p>
<p>The OpenSSL development team intentionally omits null checks for performance reasons, and further notes that there no known ways to pass null values in OpenSSL <em>that lead to vulnerabilities</em>.</p>
<p>OSTIF consulted two other security experts regarding this issue, and both agreed that while null checks can be a best practice for a defense-in-depth code strategy, it is unlikely that a vulnerability from a lack of null checks will surface unless it is portions of the code that can be called remotely.</p>
<p>This is a small best practices issue that does not cause any known vulnerability or problem, and the expert opinions on the real impact differ, and the OpenSSL team did not patch.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>OpenSSL has successfully transitioned to TLS 1.3 without any serious security problems that we’ve found. The code quality and comments could stand to be improved in areas, but the code is functional, secure, and fast. The OpenSSL security team was fantastic throughout the entire process, assisting us with questions and quickly responding to concerns that were raised as we found them.</p>
<p>Our work on OpenSSL has led to a total of 16 recommendations and changes in OpenSSL, and we will be adding OpenSSL to our bug bounty program for version 1.1.1a and later through our partnership with the <a href="https://internetbugbounty.org/"><span style="color: #289dcc;">Internet Bug Bounty</span></a> on <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/"><span style="color: #289dcc;">HackerOne</span></a>.</p>

<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with the release of OpenVPN 2.4.2 which fixes all of the high priority concerns.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Fixes:</strong></h2>
<p>Because of this audit, the OpenVPN development team has issued a number of fixes in OpenVPN 2.4.2.</p>
<p><strong>The fixes include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of a pre-authentication Denial of Service attack</em>.</span> An attacker can crash any OpenVPN client or server without any credentials or keys.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of an authenticated user Denial of Service attack</em>.</span> An attacker can crash an OpenVPN client or server using an AEAD mode cipher by sending crafted data to exhaust the packet counter. Requires authentication.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of issues in mbedtls (PolarSSL) X509 certificate handling.</em></span> Verify return values of mbedtls_x509_dn_gets and mbedtls_x509_serial_gets correctly.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of usernames and passwords not being properly erased.</em></span> for the new bootloader. (keystrokes not erased after authentication)</li>
<li><em><span style="color: #cc284b;">Correction of null pointer dereferences.</span> </em><em>Because this issue is low-severity and not exploitable, this fix is reserved for a future release.</em></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Correction of service handling for OpenVPN GUI.</em></span> The OpenVPN GUI did not properly terminate the service when closed.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Improvements to documentation of the OpenVPN protocol.</em></span> Improving transparency of functionality for developers working with the OpenVPN protocol.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Updates to user documentation for other vulnerabilities that can be closed by user practices</em>.</span> Such as selecting more secure options, and deprecating antiquated options that are unsafe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Furthermore the following was affirmed:<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When using OpenSSL, OpenVPN uses the<strong> RAND_bytes </strong>function for entropy exclusively. It appears to utilize it correctly with proper error handling.</li>
<li>When using mbedTLS, OpenVPN uses the <strong>mbedtls_ctr_drbg_random</strong> function for entropy exclusively. It appears to utilize it correctly with proper error handling.</li>
<li>When generating “non critical” random values, OpenVPN uses a custom algorithm that is <strong>non-standard but cryptographically sound</strong>.</li>
<li>OpenVPN contains some legacy code related to end-of-life versions of OpenSSL that are no longer supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cryptography Engineering focused on the cryptography aspects of OpenVPN, and gave a list of recommended changes to improve the general cryptographic strength of OpenVPN.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Correction of authentication token handling in TLS auth while in an error state.</span> This has a commit in the 2.4 branch and will be fixed in a future release. It is low-impact.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Potential loss of privacy with TLS auth or TLS crypt IV collision.</span> The OpenVPN team is updating documentation and disagrees with the wording of a “total loss of privacy”. These functions protect already encrypted data with a second layer of encryption.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of the –no-IV option.</span> The OpenVPN team has slated this option for deprecation and will be eliminated entirely in OpenVPN 2.5 and later.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of the –no-replay option.</span> The OpenVPN team has stated that this feature is for debugging only, and should not be used outside of that context.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of the –reneg-bytes option.</span> The OpenVPN team has stated that this will break configurations of OpenVPN that use One Time Pads, and needs to be left in for compatibility.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Increase the strength of default encryption options.</span> OpenVPN 2.4 and greater has stronger defaults in that cipher negotiation is used and defaults to AES-256-GCM, while also allowing stronger future ciphers to be supported provided that both the client and server support it.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Warn about insecure modes of operation.</span> OpenVPN will now issue a serious warning when –cipher none or –auth none is used.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Remove system() from sample authentication plugin.</span> There is a commit for this fix ready for a future release, likely for 2.4.3 or 2.4.4.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of –script-security 3.</span> The OpenVPN team disagrees with the severity of the safety risks in the recommendation. The command will remain as-is, possibly with a documentation change.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Removal of –tls-verify due to non-specific vulnerability.</span> The OpenVPN team failed to find any issues with the current implementation.</li>
<li><span style="color: #28cc57;">Warn users about compression use.</span> As of 2.4.3 and higher, users will be warned about the risks of combining compression with streamed data.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>OpenVPN is much safer after these audits, and the fixes applied to the OpenVPN mean that the world is safer when using this software. We have verified that the OpenVPN software is generally well-written with strong adherence to security practices.</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/?p=865&amp;preview=true">New Attacks on Privacy Show That Legal Solutions Cant Be Relied On</a></h1>
<p>One of the core concepts that motivated me to create the OSTIF is the belief that the Internet is an enormous tool for good. In order for us to be able to enjoy the fruits of free information, we need to have agency over our data. Everyone in the world needs to be able to protect their private information, and share information that they wish to be public, and be aware of what information is public and what information is protected, and to what degree these things are shared.</p>
<p>There is a sentiment among supporters of these core ideas that there are legal solutions to these problems. There are some problems with this approach, namely that the expectation is that governments around the world are going to act in the interest of their respective citizenry. Evidence contrary to this is building up worldwide, as spying scandals pile up, draconian surveillance laws are proposed, and consolidation of power for Internet companies continues to centralize market forces for the entirety of the web.</p>
<p>This leads us to a logical conclusion. If we want to keep the Internet truly free, we need to build technological solutions to the surveillance problem. This means real encryption and real security baked into products that we use. Protocols and standards must be re-engineered with privacy in mind, and customers need to show that security is a feature that they demand.</p>
<p>Let me be clear and candid. Projects like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and institutions like the ACLU provide us with powerful legal representation that fight the good fight politically, but they can&#8217;t win every fight, and we need a perfect score to be able to justify the legal route as a privacy panacea.</p>
<p>Technological solutions revoke the ability for the companies and governments to choose whether or not their citizens get privacy. We need to rally support for the projects that are fighting the good fight to fix this increasingly real problem. Companies, Governments, Criminals, and Spies do not have a right to your data. You have a right to privacy. Support the projects in the trenches making this a reality.</p>

<p>The OpenVPN audit is going to be carried out as planned by QuarksLab&#8217;s Gabriel Campana and Jean-Baptiste Bedrune on February 15th 2017. There will be 90 man-days of work completed throughout this audit and it will take approximately 45 days to complete.</p>
<p>During this time period, we will work with the OpenVPN team to address issues as they are found on the fly. Once we are confident that the issues have been addressed, we will release the full results of the audit to the public. We expect to have final results released to the public by April 7th 2017.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/?p=710">The OpenVPN Fundraiser Has Hit It&#8217;s Goal &#8211; Work On The Audit Begins</a></h1>
<p>We are delighted to announce that the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund has surpassed it&#8217;s target goal of<strong> $71,000 USD</strong> with two weeks of fundraising to spare! We are continuing to seek donations until fundraising officially ends on January 1st.</p>
<h2>Our community: A coalition for positive change and a stronger OpenVPN.</h2>
<p>This accomplishment is due to an overwhelmingly strong response from the community, where we have built a coalition of 33 companies and many individuals who have donated and helped spread the word about our cause.</p>
<p>We want to give a special thank you to our largest supporters <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a> and <a href="https://www.ipredator.se/">iPredator</a>, whose generous contributions make up more than half of the total money raised! Their help is instrumental in making this audit happen and moving the effort forward. We also want to thank ThatOnePrivacyGuy from <a href="https://thatoneprivacysite.net/">ThatOnePrivacySite</a> for helping us create incentives for VPN providers to contribute to the cause through a special recognition category for VPNs that contribute back to the privacy community. And a special thank you to the Reddit community for helping us spread the word around the world about our cause.</p>
<h2>Why does fundraising continue? Where does money raised beyond the goal go?</h2>
<p>The overflow funds are being reserved for the bug bounty program that will begin after the OpenSSL audit finishes in mid 2017. This will be a program where researchers can submit new security bugs to the developers of the projects that have already been audited by OSTIF for up to $5000 in rewards. When this program begins, it will cover VeraCrypt, OpenVPN, and OpenSSL and OSTIF will need a $50,000 pool to set aside for award payouts that will need to be periodically replenished by donations overages from other projects. The bug-bounty program is the crucial next-step in improving our supported apps. It draws in the attention of reverse-engineers, white hats, and academics to do additional research into the functionality of the apps and find irregularities that can lead to security vulnerabilities. After a professional audit, bringing the eyes of the crypto world to the project is what will keep these apps as strong as they can possibly be.</p>
<h2>What is the next step in the OpenVPN audit process?</h2>
<p>Now that we have the funds, we will contact QuarksLab and reserve a team of two senior researchers to conduct the audit. We have decided internally that because we already have a world-renowned cryptographer auditing the core crypto of OpenVPN (Dr Matthew Green), our team of researchers will focus on software vulnerabilities and exploit analysis. We think that these combinations of skills will lead to the best possible analysis of OpenVPN as a whole.</p>
<p>We have a tentative agreement for the head of our QuarksLab team to be Gabriel Campana. Those in security circles might remember his recent impressive <a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/xen-exploitation-part-3-xsa-182-qubes-escape.html">Qubes OS + Xen Paravirtualization escape exploit</a>. This elegant exploit chain allowed an attacker to take full control of a Xen based server that was running Qubes OS, one of the most security focused Linux distros today. In the demonstration, a simple script allowed the user to escape the Qubes instance and take full control of any other instance in the machine, regardless of permissions. We can also see some of his excellent <a href="https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/D1T3%20-%20F%20Raynal%20&amp;%20G%20Campana%20-%20An%20Attack%20Path%20to%20Jailbreaking%20Your%20Home%20Router.pdf">audit work on set-top boxes here</a>.</p>
<h1>Thank You All For Supporting OSTIF</h1>
<p>This is an enormous accomplishment for OSTIF and the privacy community. Thank you to each and every person who contributed to the project by donating and spreading the word. We are going to continue to do great things and make a real difference in the safety of the digital world that we all share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Progress! Goals! Collaboration!</h1>
<p>We are reporting in with more progress updates on our<strong> fundraising</strong>, more specifics on our<strong> goals</strong>, and some positive news about<strong> collaboration</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fundraising:<br />
</strong>We have secured substantially more funding over the last few days, increasing our total cash raised to $41000. This places us at about 60% of our $71000 goal! We have had widespread support for the effort and now have a coalition of 21 companies and many individual donors from around the world.</p>
<p>We have completed our first round of contact with every VPN company in the world, and are now moving on to web hosting companies, internet security companies, and other businesses who are likely interested in a stronger OpenVPN.</p>
<p>The community has done a great job of getting the word out, and we need to keep it up! Be loud! If you&#8217;ve donated, give us a shoutout on Twitter ( @ostifofficial ) or tell your friends! Getting the word out is the greatest challenge we face, and you can help! If your VPN hasn&#8217;t donated yet, let them know that you want them to support the effort and get involved!</p>
<p><strong>Goals:<br />
</strong>We have finalized an agreement with QuarksLab on a price, duration, and depth of the audit. Our goal of $71000 is now cemented and we will be getting 45 man-days (about 650 man-hours) of auditing work done by a team of two senior researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration:<br />
</strong>As we had mentioned in our earlier postings, we were surprised to find out that a large VPN had decided to fund their own independent effort in full, and they had secured a top researcher to also evaluate the same version of OpenVPN that we were building this enormous effort to audit. We were concerned because the VPN company was not communicating with us, and we had heard through 3rd parties that they had no intention of collaborating with us. This worried us about our audit being seen as redundant or wasteful, even though experts in the field would agree that more review is always better.</p>
<p>We were hoping for a situation where the two audits could work together to make the greatest impact for OpenVPN, by auditing complementary areas of code or sharing results with one another to avoid redundancies and wasted effort by researchers.</p>
<p>We have be in contact with Dr. Green and we have had a positive conversation about collaboration. It looks like we will be able to turn these two separate audits into an even greater and more thorough review than either project would be able to do alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Fundraising Is Going Well, Progress Is Fast!</h1>
<p>We have had a lot of early success with our OpenVPN fundraiser, and the community response to the project has been tremendous with privacy advocates, VPN review sites, and VPN providers coming together to raise over $34,000 USD over the last two weeks. We think we are on track to meet our fundraising goals and get the audit process under way by January 1st 2017 as planned.</p>
<p>One of the common questions that we had on Reddit was about fundraising goals for how much we want to raise in order to meet our goals. Our response was vague because we were working on a large deal behind the scenes with a major IT company to secure some or even the majority of the funding through them alone. We were afraid of setting our goals too low and having the deal fall through, or setting the goal high and then lowering it when the deal went through. Either situation could be seen as misleading, and as a transparent organization we have attempted to stay as clear as possible to the public, while avoiding any possibilities for us to be seen in a bad light.</p>
<p>We regret to say that this deal with the major IT company has in fact fallen through. While this means that we have more fundraising to do, we can also be significantly more clear about how much money we need, who will be doing the audit, and how close we are to our goals.</p>
<p>The audit will be carried out by QuarksLab in Paris. Their exemplary job on a shoestring budget for the <a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/VeraCrypt-Audit-Final-for-Public-Release.pdf">VeraCrypt audit</a> has encouraged us to move forward with them on future projects. Fred, Jean-Baptiste, and Marion did fantastic work for us and we are looking forward to seeing what they can do on a full audit.</p>
<p>Our required budget for this project is estimated to be $71000 USD. This is due to the complexities of OpenVPN across many platforms, and the large number of dependencies. <strong>This places the current state of our fundraising at about 50% of our goal with just two weeks of fundraising under our belts!</strong> The support from the community has been strong and diverse, with donors from all over the world.</p>
<h1>Healthy Competition: A VPN Provider Has Decided To Do It Alone.</h1>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong></p>
<p>Two days ago, we learned about another effort to get OpenVPN 2.4 audited. We are thrilled to know that there are VPN companies that are willing to contribute significantly to the OpenVPN project. Unfortunately, this decision appears to have been made after OSTIF reached out to them for support multiple times, and the news came after two weeks of public fundraising had already been completed and a coalition of twenty VPN providers and dozens of other businesses had already been built.</p>
<p>They have made it clear that they have no intention to support the community effort, nor will their audit project collaborate with ours for the greater good.</p>
<p><strong>What OSTIF management thinks about this effort: </strong></p>
<p>We do not know the circumstances that led up to their decision. We have reached out to them directly and through multiple parties to collaborate on this effort. The only response we have received was through a 3rd party, and that they do not intend to collaborate. We are confused as to their intentions with this effort, but the evidence leads us to believe that this is an effort to derail the community audit, and possibly take all of the credit for themselves for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>There is also very little information about their effort, its scope, and who is doing the audit beyond one person.</p>
<p>This effort appears to have been significantly rushed, with the OpenVPN staff learning of this new effort three days prior to this writing. We had been collaborating with OpenVPN Technologies and the community on this effort for over six months, and carefully planning the fundraising and timing for the project.</p>
<p>We also took significant steps to try to select auditors who are not from nations in the Five-Eyes Intelligence Alliance because the OpenVPN 2.x has major contributions from Fox-IT, whose parent company is NCC Group, which has close ties with the government of the United Kingdom. We wanted to avoid any situation where it could be viewed by the world that a five-eyes company was auditing an app with significant contributions from groups that are tied to that same company.</p>
<p>We strive for impartiality and transparency at all steps of the process.</p>
<p><strong>What OSTIF intends to do moving forward:</strong></p>
<p>The position of OSTIF, after having meetings with our managers and our board of trustees, is that we are going to continue fundraising with the community, and we will execute the audit as planned. If the other audit group changes their minds, and wishes to collaborate on the project for the greater good of the community, we are open to it at any time.</p>
<p>We will complete a thorough and full audit on a tight timetable and continue with our goals to complete audits of our supported applications and move them on to the next stages of support. Our goals are to create stronger security and privacy tools for all, even when faced with resistance from moneyed interests.</p>
<p>These audits will only make OpenVPN <em><strong>safer</strong></em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-645 size-full" src="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/donatenowbutton.png" alt="donatenowbutton" width="250" height="74" /></a></p>
<p>The details about the value of this effort and the power of OSTIF are below:</p>
<p><strong>Why OpenVPN?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/download/community-downloads.html">OpenVPN</a> is a cross platform and well supported Virtual Private Network application that is free to use for everyone around the world. It is available for all versions of Windows, OSX, Android, iOS, Chrome OS, most versions of Linux, and BSD. It is used worldwide by businesses to protect information that goes over insecure networks, and increasingly it is used by private users who want to protect their information from cybercrime and surveillance. OpenVPN is powerful, free, and used by millions of people. An audit of OpenVPN will add further integrity to the software, allowing users around the world to trust that the software is strong and resistant to intrusion.</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>OpenVPN version 2.4 has just entered beta, with a full release to soon follow. As the first major revision of the software to be released in years, it has a huge number of bug fixes and feature changes under the hood, giving an audit a great opportunity to review these new areas of code that will likely persist for years with small changes until OpenVPN 2.5 is ready to go. It is the most effective time for an audit to take place.</p>
<p><strong>Why OSTIF?</strong></p>
<p>We are an independent advocate for free and open software that improves the security of users around the world. We are efficient, open, and ready to tackle the problems that face free software. We have just completed our<a href="https://ostif.org/the-veracrypt-audit-results/"> audit of VeraCrypt 1.18</a> a few months ago, and we are striking while the iron is hot to continue making harder and more powerful security software for all of us.</p>
