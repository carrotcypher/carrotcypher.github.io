										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Amazon Web Services Supports Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director, Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc (OSTIF)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OSTIF team is absolutely thrilled to announce that we’ve reached an agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide $500,000 in funding. The funding from AWS will help OSTIF scale our ability to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical open source projects. In particular, the goal is to improve the sustainability of upstream projects commonly used in the open source ecosystem.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2022 proved to be an impactful year for OSTIF, as we executed over 20 security engagements for critical open source projects; resulting in over 35 Critical/High Vulnerability patches and upwards of 165 total security improvements. Approximately 50 automated security tools, such as fuzzers and CI implementations, were developed to continuously monitor these projects, providing long-term benefits to security posture. The support from AWS will allow us to continue to do that into 2023 and scale our ability to help critical open source projects that everyone depends on.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Amir Montazery, Managing Director, OSTIF</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Creating healthy and sustainable open source communities is the guiding principle behind our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source investments. By sponsoring OSTIF and OpenSSF, we are helping to ensure the long-term security and viability of critical open source software projects that will benefit our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customers, AWS, and the entire information technology ecosystem..&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Mark Ryland, Director, Office of the CISO, Amazon Web Services</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today OSTIF is thrilled to release the Independent Security Audit Impact Report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This report is the culmination of over a year’s worth of work that OSTIF organized thanks to funding from Google and OpenSSF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am extremely proud of this work and what OSTIF continues to accomplish. Organizations like Google, OpenSSF, and many others are eager to fund initiatives that help secure the open source ecosystem, and I firmly believe that OSTIF is one of the best outlets for doing just that. We were able to take almost $1,000,000 and turn it into significant security improvements to critical projects in one year.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is thrilled to announce its first philanthropic partnership with <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a> (ON). OSTIF is joining a strong network of open source advocates and specialists under the ON portfolio to further the Open and Secure Internet Ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>“This is a significant accomplishment for OSTIF and expands our network with tech philanthropy. Omidyar Network’s support will augment our commitment to a strong and secure open source ecosystem”</em> said Amir Montazery, Managing Director of OSTIF.</p>
<p>While OSTIFs primary focus is helping projects improve security posture through audits, supply chain review, building security tools, and providing fixes, this partnership focuses on fundraising and messaging. Improving OSTIFs messaging and extending reach will help the organization gain new partnerships and magnify our impact. This positive feedback loop will continue to help OSTIF grow and add services to our already comprehensive work.</p>
<p>This partnership comes at a perfect time for OSTIF, as the organization is releasing Impact Reports from its current partnerships (see: <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/08/08/improving-cncf-security-posture-with-independent-security-audits/">CNCF Impact Report</a> post) and fundraising for 2023. With over 150 security vulnerabilities found and fixed, including 10 critical severity and 25 high severity fixes in the first half of 2022 alone, OSTIF is growing its impact on improving the security of the open source ecosystem. Recent fixes include Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DOS), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in tech stacks used in a majority of global cloud vendors and their clients. For OSTIF, more funding means more security audits, more vulnerability fixes, and greater improvement to open source projects.</p>
<p>A big thank you to Govind Shivkumar of Omidyar Network, Michael Brennan from the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/">Ford Foundation</a>, and Kim Lewandowski of <a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/">Chainguard</a> for all their help and support in getting this partnership off the ground.</p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duckduckgo</a>, the privacy search engine, has contributed to OSTIF for a second time by donating $25,000 USD. Their site that tracks their charitable donations <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/2021-duckduckgo-donations/">Spread Privacy</a> has the official announcement.</p>
<p>These funds are not allocated to any specific project, which helps OSTIF tremendously by allowing us to spend resources on overhead costs of doing business that the organization needs to spend money on to function. Most of our funding from corporate donors comes with specific projects in mind and doesn&#8217;t significantly help the core organization function.</p>
<p>Duckduckgo originally donated to OSTIF for <a href="https://ostif.org/the-veracrypt-audit-results/">our first project, VeraCrypt</a>, which helped prove that our concept worked and ultimately led to where we are today, nearly six years later. Their continued support shows their commitment to keeping the open source projects we rely on secure.</p>
<p>And a special thank you to Katie and Charlie for helping to make this happen!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After months of fundraising, we have reached our goal to fund the <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound DNS</a> audit!</p>
<p>We would like to thank the primary supporters of this security review, <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a> and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>.</p>
<p>Unbound DNS is DNS server software that offers both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DNS-over-TLS (aka DoT)</a> functionality. It is used in hundreds of other open source projects as a security anchor that prevents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing">DNS cache poisoning</a>. It is a crucial piece of infrastructure and a thorough security review will give us the broad assurances that the world needs to rely on Unbound.</p>
<p>The next steps for this project are to figure out the available dates for the team to do the security review, and make the initial payment for the work to be done. Then X41 D-Sec will carry out the audit and report their findings to the Unbound DNS security team for review and to assist with any potential fixes that are needed.</p>
<p>From there, patches will be created and once updates are pushed, we will proceed with releasing all of our results to the public.</p>

<p>It has been a while since we have done a round of updates on what we are working on.</p>



<p>We have a number of projects that are currently active and more starting up. Throughout 2019 we expect to finish more than twice as many total projects and to continue with our current commitments to transparency and public review.</p>



<p>In the immediate future, you should see an update to our public books for 2018, which will show where every dollar that we took in was spent. We will also release a separate financial report that shows our goals and how we fared with our actual financial management for the year. (We are expecting the results to look good!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here is a list of our current projects and their status:</h2>



<p><strong>VeraCrypt</strong> &#8211; Maintenance &#8211; We have audited the software and it is currently active on our bug bounty program on HackerOne through our partnership with the Internet Bug Bounty.</p>



<p><strong>OpenVPN</strong> &#8211; Maintenance &#8211; We have audited version 2.4.0 and are preparing a second round of audits for version 2.5.0. It is currently active on our bug bounty program on HackerOne through our partnership with the Internet Bug Bounty.</p>
