										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ostif.org">OSTIF</a>, working with the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/monero">Monero Community</a>, the Monero development team, <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/">Monero Research Lab</a> and <a href="https://sweetwater.consulting/">Sweetwater Asset Consulting</a>, has completed our latest security review of Monero CLSAG.</p>

<p>Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signatures are a new variant of Monero&#8217;s current MLSAG (Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature) scheme. Overall, it promises to further reduce the size of Monero signatures while maintaining all of the privacy characteristics of Monero.</p>
<p>JP Aumasson and Antony Vennard conducted a two phase review of CLSAG. First, they reviewed the theoretical construction presented in the Monero CLSAG paper by Brandon Goodell, Sarang Noether, and Arthur Blue. The latest version is published here:  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654.pdf</a> Second, they reviewed the code as it will be implemented in Monero to ensure that the implementation maintains the security properties that the paper establishes. Additionally, the CLSAG code was reviewed for general code errors that could lead to security issues.</p>
<p>Because of this audit, the foundational design of CLSAG has improved through improvements to the formal paper, and peer review has verified that the overall security of the scheme is reasonably sound and ready for live use.</p>
<h2><strong>Review of the CLSAG Paper</strong></h2>
<p>Proofs in cryptography are similar to proofs in mathematics, where security properties that are assumed must have prior work that confirms that the assumption made by the researchers is true. You build new ideas on these base assumptions to create something new and novel, and previous proofs support your novel construction&#8217;s claims be it for security, privacy, anonymity, unforgeability, or other functionality that you seek.  The findings from Jean-Philippe and Antony led to many improvements to the paper for academic rigor. This includes problems like unsupported security assumptions, readability issues,  and properly defining the definitions of terms. These are largely issues with an academic proof that would not affect the strength of CLSAG, however, the paper serves as a blueprint for building a novel signature scheme, and errors in proofs can lead to unforeseen weaknesses in the design and implementation phases of the code.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have a good confidence that the construction proposed satisfies the intended security goals, yet a moderate confidence that the proofs are entirely valid.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>After the edits to the CLSAG paper, the auditors are more confident that CLSAG has strong, valid, security proofs.</strong></span></p>
<p>Overall the team found that CLSAG is well constructed for its use-case in Monero. Some gaps were identified that may affect the overall security strength of the scheme, but the audit team found that the security is likely &#8220;strong enough&#8221; to thwart any attempts to break the signature scheme.</p>
<h2><strong>Review of the CLSAG Implementation in Monero</strong></h2>
<p>Monero CLSAG&#8217;s code was reviewed using both static and dynamic analysis, meaning JP and Antony both manually reviewed the code and used automated tools to search for additional potential problems (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cppcheck">cppCheck</a>, <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql">CodeQL</a>, and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/">clang-tidy</a>).</p>
<p>Overall, the team found no major issues with the implementation. Suggestions were made to improve the design in a future version of CLSAG, such as using built-in features of C++ to securely erase data from memory after its use.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Overall, we believe the code implements the CLSAG scheme as desired accurately and<br />
provides a high level security.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The audit team found that the code is clean, easy to read, and well designed. Additionally, the CLSAG code reuses well-tested and well-understood components in its design. Lastly, the code is also well commented for understanding error-handling. Being a C++ application, the authors recommend extending Monero&#8217;s current unit-testing and fuzzing to include CLSAG&#8217;s code to further check for general C++ problems like null pointer errors, bounds checking, memory handling, and error handling.</p>
<p>Only two recommendations were made by the reviewers:</p>
<h3>key struct misuse prevention</h3>
<p>The reviewers recommend an improved technique to ensure that secure memory erasure takes place after data is used and no longer required.</p>
<h3>Unnecessary code duplication</h3>
<p>There are two functions in CLSAG that perform nearly-identical functions and can be combined. This is to further simplify code as a best practice and does not impact security, privacy, or performance.</p>
<h2><strong>The CLSAG Audit Paper</strong></h2>
<p>As always, all of OSTIF&#8217;s sponsored research is available, in full, for free. Consider supporting our work through <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/">donating to OSTIF</a> and encouraging your company to <a href="https://ostif.org/sponsorship/">sponsor OSTIF&#8217;s security research</a>. We would like to extend a special thank you to the Monero community for funding this project and assisting with OSTIF&#8217;s operational expenses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OSTIF is simultaneously working on multiple projects this quarter. Here is what we&#8217;ve been working on and what to expect over the next few months!</p>
<h2>Two projects with the Linux Foundation</h2>
<p>We are working with the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a> on the safety and security of the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux Kernel</a>. We are working with Atredis Partners on evaluating the processes and policies for the Kernel&#8217;s security reporting, update, and disclosure processes to seek potential areas of improvement. This is something that the Kernel team has sought to review for years and OSTIF worked with our network of partners to bring the best people to the table for the task. We will be keeping the public notified as this project progresses. Here is an excellent talk by Konstantin Ryabitsev on how the Linux Kernel currently receives updates: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vohrz14S6JE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vohrz14S6JE</a></p>
<p>Additionally, we are in the early stages of reviewing the handling of software signing keys for the kernel, and how they are used for signing updates to the Kernel. We will have more information about this project in the near future.</p>
<h2>Two Projects with the Monero Community</h2>
<p>We are working with the Monero community on CLSAG. CLSAG promises to reduce signature sizes considerably while maintaining the same privacy level that Monero currently enjoys. Jean-Philipe Aumasson and Antony Vennard of <a href="https://teserakt.io/">Teserakt</a> will be reviewing both the theoretical paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654.pdf">here</a> and the implementation <a href="https://github.com/SarangNoether/monero/tree/clsag-device">here</a> after approval by the security committee and a round of fundraising with the Monero community.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are in the early stages of organizing and audit of Monero Triptych. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2020/018&amp;version=20200107:094009&amp;file=018.pdf">Triptych</a> promises to make transactions in Monero more efficient by increasing the efficiency of the ring signature scheme. Triptych allows Monero to significantly increase the size of rings while maintaining similar transaction sizes and verification speeds. This increase in ring size (from the current 12 to over 100) would theoretically substantially improve Monero privacy. We will be updating everyone on the status of this project as it progresses.</p>
<h2>Three VPN Related Projects</h2>
<p>We are working with the <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> team on a review of <a href="https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn">OpenVPN 2.5.0</a>, which introduces a number of new features that expand the use cases of OpenVPN. This includes and obfuscation plugin system that was developed with the <a href="https://operatorfoundation.org/">Operator Foundation</a>, whom we have also been working with to develop obfuscation plugins for OpenVPN that will be ready to go on launch.</p>
<p>We are also exploring scoping for a security review of <a href="https://wireguard.com">WireGuard&#8217;s</a> clients. This is crucially important because while WireGuard&#8217;s core code is only 5000-6000 lines and simple to review, the supporting software libraries for the individual clients adds an order of magnitude more code that doesn&#8217;t have the same brevity and quality controls of the core code. A wide-scope review of WireGuard gives the community a fine-grained review of the current security benefits of WireGuard over alternatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are exploring scoping to audit <a href="https://www.wintun.net/">WinTun</a>. WinTun is particularly important because it is the virtual driver that Windows requires for VPNs to function properly. This importance is magnified by WinTun also apparently performing better than tap-windows6 which is used by OpenVPN, and support for WinTun being added to OpenVPN. This means that WinTun will likely be the primary TAP/TUN driver for both OpenVPN and WireGuard in the future, so the security properties of WinTun are crucial.</p>
<h2>Reaching Out to RIOT.IM</h2>
<p>We have learned that the RIOT messenger team is seeking a security review of their project. So far we have been unsuccessful in our attempts to contact them. We will continue to try to reach out to assist the project and explore if collaboration is possible.</p>
<h2>Seeking Additional Sources of Funding</h2>
<p>OSTIF&#8217;s primary purpose is to bring together security resources with open source projects. As we expand on both ends of this goal, and we bring on more security teams while also having an increase in requests for support, the need for manpower grows. Two of our staff (Amir and Derek) have moved to working for OSTIF full-time.</p>
<p>Our efforts are now focused on seeking additional funding so that we can continue to effectively support projects with our time and resources. This comes in the form of us reaching out to more organizations for support, including large corporations and governments in the form of cybersecurity grants. Sponsorships and grants will be key for OSTIF going forward, as we continue to expand and magnify the amount of good we can do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>As always, remember that our work only happens with the support of our sponsors and the community. Consider <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/">donating to the cause</a> and getting the companies that you work at and patronize to get involved. We are always short on funding and more money always means more research. Special thank you&#8217;s to <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>, <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/">Monero Research Lab</a>, <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a>, <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/">ExpressVPN</a>, and <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a> for contributing to OSTIF and helping us move the open-source world forward. This project was primarily supported with funds from the Monero community and Monero Research Lab.</h5>
<p>We have been working with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/">Monero community</a>, <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>, <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/">Monero Research Lab</a>, and four audit teams to conduct a deep an thorough review of RandomX, a new proof of work algorithm that aims to push the &#8220;egalitarian ideal&#8221; for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>RandomX aims to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">highly-optimized custom hardware</a> slower or far less efficient than general purpose computer hardware that is available to everyone. The thinking behind this move is that hardware that is available to everyone is far more likely to be used by the general populace and enthusiasts, which hedges against centralization of the computing power that is verifying cryptocurrency transactions.</p>
<p>One of the classic problems with cryptocurrency is that if any one party (or a collaborating cartel of malicious parties) were to possess at least 51% of the computing power of the network, they can re-write transactions to duplicate currency, invalidate real transactions, or otherwise manipulate the network. The rise of custom equipment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASICs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGAs</a>) has given groups that are willing to commit those resources majority stakes in this computing power (aka hashing power).</p>
<p>RandomX aims to solve this problem by making the algorithm too complex for ASICs and FPGAs to effectively optimize. They will either be significantly slower, too costly to build due to complexity, or too expensive to run compared to general purpose hardware (in electricity costs).</p>
<p>RandomX is a brand-new idea, but it employs a lot of well known cryptographic functions and applies them in interesting ways.</p>
<p>In order to verify the security properties of RandomX, Monero Research Lab, The Monero Community, and Arweave have all contributed significantly to sponsor security research that we all coordinated together.</p>
<p>These four audits were done in a series, with the results and fixes from each audit feeding into the next one. This series of cascading audits gave us perspectives from different teams as well as opportunities to look at aspects of code that others didn&#8217;t focus on, leading to a thorough overall security review.</p>
<h2>The Scope</h2>
<p>The goal of these audits is to determine not only that the coding and cryptography are error free, but that the implementation does not easily allow an ASIC or FPGA design to function with a significant advantage over general-purpose hardware.</p>
<h2>The Broad Strokes</h2>
<p>All four security teams agree that the RandomX code is of very high quality, but that the documentation could be improved in order to prevent implementation mistakes in non-Monero and non-Arweave blockchains. None of the four teams found cryptographic short cuts in the code that would allow a significant speedup in hashing power due to a bug, nor functions or components of RandomX that could be easily bypassed with hardware optimization (ASIC or FPGA). The consensus is that the code is near deployment-ready, and that over time some small coding practice changes and documentation improvements can further improve safety as RandomX evolves and changes over time with updates. Some suggestions to further harden RandomXs resistance to hardware optimization have also been detailed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span></strong> = A patch was applied that corrects this issue.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span></strong> = Clarification given by the RandomX team indicates that the issue does not need patching for other reasons.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">DISPUTED</span></strong> = The RandomX team disagrees with the assessment.</p>
<p>If an issue does not have a status, it is because the issue is still being discussed between the teams. It does not indicate a dispute, only that OSTIF does not know the current status. The status of the issues will be updated here as we learn more about them.</p>
<h2>Audit 1 &#8211; <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a> sponsored by <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a></h2>
<p><strong>Issue 1 &#8211;</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong> FIXED </strong></span><strong>&#8211; Single Round Used in AesGenerator</strong><br />
RandomX was using a single round of AES in order to achieve diffusion. You need at least two rounds of AES to fully mix the source data. This is problematic because in an exploit scenario, if an attacker were able to find a similar bias in other components of RandomX, pieces of the algorithm could be effectively skipped without computation, allowing for a simpler ASIC or FPGA design to be feasible. This would only be achievable if a similar problem was present across many RandomX functions, which was not the case. Nevertheless, <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/46">RandomX has now been updated to use AesGenerator4R, which performs four rounds of AES to properly mix and diffuse the data.</a></p>
<p><strong>Issue 2 &#8211;</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong> FIXED </strong></span><strong>&#8211; Insufficient Testing and Validation of VM Correctness</strong><br />
RandomX uses a Virtual Machine, but does not have a machine-readable specification to test against. This is important because as the implementation changes, very small changes can lead to forks at unpredictable locations in the blockchain. Being able to test against a specification detects these (potentially rare and hard to detect) problems before they become an issue on the live-chain. Testing has been significantly expanded, with unit testing available for every RandomX insruction.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 3 &#8211;</strong><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong> FIXED </strong></span><strong>&#8211; RandomX Configurable Parameters are Brittle &#8211; </strong><strong><a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/59">Pull Request 59</a></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><br />
</strong></span>RandomX has a lot of configuration options, in order to allow multiple cryptocurrency projects to implement RandomX. Some of these options can significantly damage the security and ASIC resistance properties of RandomX. It is strongly recommended that at the very least comments are added to parameters that have a significant impact on the security and robustness of RandomX, and it should be a long term goal to remove the ability to choose unsafe parameters entirely.The RandomX team has added checks to make sure that value are sane, and they have also added significantly more documentation about which values to select.<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Additional Miscellany</strong><br />
Some code quality improvement suggestions. Suggested improvements to randomness in SuperscalarHash. Trail of Bits also did a complex randomness analysis of RandomX and found it select various paths sufficiently, which prevents optimizing for specific paths that are selected more often via a bias. They also provided an excellent resource on which tunable parameters are safe to change in RandomX and which should be left alone. (Section E.) They also recommended specific values for Arweave, the sponsor of Trail of Bits&#8217; research.</p>
<p>The full Arweave paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits/raw/master/Report-TrailOfBits.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Audit 2 &#8211; <a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/">Kudelski Security</a> sponsored by OSTIF, Monero Research Lab, and the Monero Community</h2>
<p>(Redundant findings from Audit 1 by Trail of Bits have been omitted.)</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1 &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span> &#8211; Usage of Unoptimized BLAKE2</strong><br />
RandomX&#8217;s version of the BLAKE2 hash function is unoptimized and does not take advantage of AVX512 CPU optimization. A speedup of up to 40% can be achieved by using an optimized version of BLAKE2. However, the overall performance of RandomX is not dependent on BLAKE2, so the only real advantage of improving this code is power consumption / cpu time. The RandomX team is exploring the use of LibSodium&#8217;s optimized implementation of BLAKE2 for a future release.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; Lack of NULL Checks &#8211; </strong><a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/88"><strong>Pull Request 88</strong></a><br />
RandomX does not perform NULL checks when dereferencing the pointer in most areas of the code. <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html">NULL pointer dereferences</a> are a common security problem in languages that allow them. It is generally a good practice to maintain null checks even if you are confident in your code, because errors can be introduced later through updates that null checks will catch.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 3 &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span> &#8211; randomx_reciprocal() Could Divide by Zero &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/88">Pull Request 88</a></strong><br />
Dividing by zero can cause crashes and other undesired behavior. After discussion with the development team, other areas of code make sure that this value cannot be zero. A check was added anyway in pull request 88.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; randomx.cpp Has a Type Mismatch Error &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/88">Pull Request 88</a></strong><br />
This type of error can lead to an attacker using crafted inputs to force undesired behavior (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow">integer overflow</a>). The RandomX team added checks and asserts to the code in order to cause the application to crash if these invalid inputs are encountered.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 5 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; getCodeSize() Has a Potential Integer Underflow &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/95">Pull Request 95</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue 6 &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span> &#8211; randomx.cpp Doesn&#8217;t Manually Check for Blake2b Hash Errors</strong><br />
Hash errors could cause RandomX to enter an undesired state, allowing a user to bypass some steps in RandomX. Upon further investigation, there is a check for this at compile-time, but an extra layer of protection has been added to RandomX by the development team to manually check this value and to throw an assert (and crash the application) if an error is encountered.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 7 &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span> &#8211; Potential Out-of-Bound Writes in fillAes1Rx4() and fillAes4Rx4() &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/95">Pull Request 95</a></strong><br />
This was a non-issue as there are bounds checks at compile-time. Additional checks were added for safety.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 8 &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span> &#8211; isPowerOf2() Can Have an Input of Zero, Which is not a Power of 2 &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/95">Pull Request 95</a></strong><br />
A value check was mislabeled as &#8220;isPowerOf2()&#8221; and a value of Zero could be called into the function, causing potentially undesired behavior. After talking with the RandomX team, the ability to call a zero into the function was intended, but the function was renamed for better clarity on what the check is actually doing. It is now called isZeroOrPowerOf2().</p>
<h2>Audit 3 &#8211; <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41 D-Sec</a> sponsored by OSTIF, Monero Research Lab, and the Monero Community</h2>
<p><strong>Issue 1 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; Hard Coded Code Size in JIT Compiler &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/98">Pull Request 98</a></strong><br />
The RandomX JIT Compiler is hard coded to a size of 64k, which can be exceeded by changing some RandomX settings (this would affect non-Monero implementations). This could have both security and stability implications.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2 &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span> &#8211; Integer Handling in Jump-Target Calculation</strong><br />
The jump-target function does not consider edge cases that could lead to <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html">Integer Overflows or Integer Wraparounds</a>. After talking with the RandomX team, this appears to be a non-issue because there is a small range of valid inputs that prevent this issue from arising.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 3 &#8211;<span style="color: #00ff00;"> FIXED</span> &#8211; DatasetSize Does not Consider Usage in 32-bit Systems &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/99">Pull Request 99</a></strong><br />
DatasetSize can overflow to a very small number in 32-bit systems, due to the size limit of memory allocation for 32-bit addressing. After speaking with the RandomX team, RandomX is not intended to work on 32-bit legacy systems, as they will never be meaningfully competitive on a modern proof-of-work algorithm. Pull Request 99 adds a check to properly throw an error instead of silently failing.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; Incorrect Code Generated in Emulation Mode &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/98">Pull Request 98</a></strong><br />
X41 found multiple issues with RandomX running in emulation mode with non-default parameters. This is important because the default parameters are only intended to be used with Monero, and other projects will be using non-default parameters. Pull request 98 corrects these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 5 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; Insufficient Diffusion in AesGenerator4R &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/76">Pull Request 76</a></strong><br />
X41 found that key-reuse in the AesGenerator4R function allows for trivial reversal of the function. It is a best practice to use individual keys in AesGenerator4R. It is important to note that in the specific way that RandomX uses the AesGenerator4R function, this does not present a security risk because the input is a cryptographically secure hash function.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 6 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; Poor Code Coverage &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/73">Pull Request 73</a></strong><br />
X41 noted that RandomX is monolithic and that it is hard to test individual components of RandomX rather than RandomX as a whole. This is important because rare problems can be hidden within the components that don&#8217;t get tested directly. In pull request 73, test vectors were added to the code as well as additional regression testing.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 7 &#8211; <span style="color: #ff6600;">FIXED OPTIONALLY</span> &#8211; JIT Memory Pages for Generated Code are Writable and Executable &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/112">Pull Request 112</a></strong><br />
The JIT compiler has simultaneous read, write, and execute permissions which are not required. Removing the ability for the JIT compiler to write and execute at the same time mitigates the possibility of an attacker exploiting a bug in the JIT compiler to execute arbitrary code. This was fixed in pull request 112, however, the switching causes a large hit on mining performance (~30%) that will be unacceptable to most. Because of this, it has been made an option to enable/disable.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 8 &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;">SOLVED</span> &#8211; Sandboxing RandomX Execution</strong><br />
Because the use-case for RandomX is to take user data from an outside source (a block) and process it, it can&#8217;t be ruled out that an attacker could find inputs that could bypass the security properties of the RandomX Virtual Machine. Sandboxing techniques such as those provided by AppContiner or seccomp would help mitigate any possibility of such a scenario arising. The RandomX team disagrees with this assessment, because the values that an attacker can modify (sending fake blocks) are immediately fed through Blake2 hashing, which means that the inputs cannot be effectively controlled to cause an issue if a vulnerability in RandomX existed.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 9 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; Incorrect SuperScalarHash Latency when Program Size is too Small &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/98">Pull Request 98</a></strong><br />
Some combinations of parameters can cause invalid states where RandomX will run even though not enough memory is allocated for the application to function properly. Additional sanity checks for program size are recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 10 &#8211; Lack of a Machine-Readable Specification</strong><br />
RandomX doesn&#8217;t have a machine readable spec to test against, meaning that there is no easy method to test if alternative implementations of RandomX will always, in all circumstances, have the same results. Having such a specification prevents issues with interoperability, and also assists developers of alternative implementations to detect and fix bugs in their own code. As the project matures, it is imperative that a machine-readable spec is established.</p>
<p><strong>ASIC/FPGA Resistance 1 &#8211; <span style="color: #ff6600;">DISPUTED</span> &#8211; Low Reliance on Branch Prediction Unit</strong><br />
The branch prediction unit of a CPU is a complex and large component that takes up a lot of physical space on a CPU. RandomX does not rely on branch prediction logic, so an ASIC could greatly simplify a potential ASIC by simplifying the branch prediction unit. After talking with the RandomX team, this is disputed because any logic that can be predicted by a branch predictor can be implemented in an ASIC, possibly more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>ASIC/FPGA Resistance 2 &#8211; Low reliance on Front-End Scheduling Logic</strong><br />
Some parts of RandomX can be executed in parallel by using a preprocessor instead of the JIT, allowing a custom-chip design to have an advantage over CPUs. After talking with the RandomX team, this area of the code is not high-impact and does not significantly impact performance, but it would result in some power savings for an ASIC.</p>
<p><strong>ASIC/FPGA Resistance 3 &#8211; <span style="color: #ff6600;">DISPUTED</span> &#8211; Low Reliance on Other Modern CPU Elements</strong><br />
RandomX does not use many complex modern CPU features, such as: privileged instructions, interrupts and interrupt routing (x86 APIC), TLB 8 s, the MMU 9 and virtual memory in general, inter-core communication and cache coherence. While these features do not take up a lot of die space, they are very complex and require large amounts of R&amp;D to implement. Adding features to RandomX that use these CPU features would dramatically increase the cost of a custom chip. RandomX cannot implement many custom features because it is designed to work on many different CPU architectures that may lack those features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Audit 4 &#8211; <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com">QuarksLab</a> sponsored by OSTIF, Monero Research Lab, and the Monero Community</h2>
<p>This audit was conducted by QuarksLab after the conclusion and publishing of the other three audits, to maximize the impact of their review, they considered the latest build of RandomX and all of the work of the previous teams.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1 &#8211; (RNDX-N1) Usage of Hard Coded Strings<br />
</strong>RandomX made significant effort to make components of its protocol fully customizable for a safe reuse. There are six hard coded strings as seeds of various constants and keys and it&#8217;s suggested to add these strings in the configuration set for easier management and customization.<em> This is a minor code practices issue and not a security vulnerability.</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue 2 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; (RNDX-N2) Warning Against RandomX Components Reuse &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/111">Pull Request 111</a></strong><br />
While the existing implementation of the components AesHash1R, AesGenerator1R, and AesGenerator4R are sound, there should be warnings about the re-use of these functions for developers who may be tempted to use these functions elsewhere in their own implementations of RandomX. They are dangerous if used in different contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 3 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; (RNDX-M1) Argon2 Implementation Does Not Enforce Minimum Salt Size &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/111">Pull Request 111</a></strong><br />
Argon2 requires a salt of a minimum size of 8 bytes. RandomX does not enforce this and does not throw an error if the salt is too small. A lower-bound sanity check should be added.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; (RNDX-L1) RANDOMX_ARGON_LANES and RANDOMX_ARGON_ITERATIONS Need Upper Bound Limits &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/111">Pull Request 111</a></strong><br />
RANDOMX_ARGON_LANES needs an upper-bound limit of 2^24-1 and RANDOMX_ARGON_ITERATIONS needs an upper-bound limit of 2^32-1.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 5 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; (RNDX-L2) RANDOMX_ARGON_MEMORY Needs A Lower Bound Limit of 8 &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/111">Pull Request 111</a></strong><br />
It has a lower-bound limit, but it is currently 1 which doesn&#8217;t consider that ARGON2_SYNC_POINTS = 4.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 6 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; (RNDX-L3) Missing 64-byte Alignment of mx and ma in the Specifications &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/111">Pull Request 111</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue 7 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; (RNDX-M2) Error in Computation of DataOffset</strong><br />
The calculations for DataOffset did not match the specification. After QuarksLab discussed this with the RandomX team, it was discovered that this was a snippet of legacy code from an older implementation of RandomX. This issue has been corrected.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 8 &#8211; <span style="color: #00ff00;">FIXED</span> &#8211; (RNDX-M3) RandomX Key Size Limit Not Enforced &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/pull/111">Pull Request 111</a></strong><br />
RandomX specifies a 60-byte input key, but larger keys can be loaded without error. After talking with the RandomX team, larger keys are truncated to 60 bytes by design. RandomX now informs users when longer keys have been truncated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is working with the Monero community to fund at least two (and probably three) audits of Monero RandomX.</p>
<h2>What is RandomX?</h2>
<p>RandomX is a project that implements a dynamic proof of work algorithm. The aim of an algorithm that changes is to make it difficult to design efficient circuitry that can fully automate the algorithm in an ASIC. The increased complexity of the algorithm makes it so that an ASIC would lose the advantages that it has over more traditional CPU/GPU designs that can execute many types of code and do many types of mathematics.</p>
<p>The goal of RandomX is to be a significant boost to ASIC resistance, which is seen as a hedge against centralization.</p>
<p>Monero (and some other cryptocurrencies) are fighting to overcome significant efforts to centralize mining under ASICs, because one of the fundamental components of cryptocurrency is that access to mining needs to be egalitarian, and custom ASIC designs place the lions&#8217; share of the processing power under the control of a few centralized entities, who then gain significant control over the blockchain.</p>
<p>The community has selected three auditors, and a fourth, <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a>, is also looking at the code through an independent group <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave.org</a>.</p>
<p>The auditors are:</p>

Bulletproofs are a trustless proofs setup that are substantially smaller than the current Borromean style range proofs that were previously used, which reduces the size of Monero transactions by 80-90%.</p>
<p>Monero’s latest network update, which is now live, has enabled Bulletproofs and corrected all outstanding issues that were raised by the Kudelski and QuarksLab projects.</p>
<p><strong>QuarksLab found:</strong><br />
8 <span style="color: #cc284b;">Critical</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
2 <span style="color: #cca928;">Medium</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
20 <span style="color: #28cc57;">Low</span> or <span style="color: #28cc57;">Informational</span> Vulnerabilities / Concerns / Recommendations</p>
<hr />
<h4><span style="color: #cc284b;">One live-chain critical flaw identified and fixed:</span></h4>
<p>QuarksLab found a denial of service vulnerability that could allow an attacker to <strong>arbitrarily crash Monero nodes remotely</strong>, creating a vulnerability for a large-scale denial of service campaign for the Monero network and further potentially leading to a 51% attack and forced chain split, ultimately leading to double-spends.</p>
<p>Because this flaw impacted live code, OSTIF, QuarksLab, and the Monero team agreed to a disclosure embargo on this report until after the latest network upgrade that forced users to upgrade their nodes to patched code. The Monero XMR network is now safe from this flaw.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other serious bugs that were identified and fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>A lack of null value checks in the Bulletproofs proving algorithm.</em></span> The bulletproofs code relies on values being passed to it not being null, but did not proactively ensure that null values cannot be passed or checked for.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Dependent Generators in original java version of Bulletproofs are not secure.</em></span> The code had to be revised to improve number generation.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Overflow in double scalar multiplication.</em></span> The code needed to be patched to prevent the overflow of data.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Erroneous identity output in Bos-Coster multi-exponentiation.</em></span> The structure of the code could select the wrong input and return incorrect values.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Silently discarded element in Pippenger multi-exponentiation.</em></span> An optimization designed to discard large numbers of leading zeros could return the identity if a value of x^0 was entered into the function, meaning that the operation can return the identity unmodified. The optimization also had the additional issue of possibly discarding critical values for exact powers of two as inputs.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Invalid Verify input parameters.</em></span> There are no checks that the points provided are indeed points of Ed25519 and that they are on the main subgroup.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Key compromise in Schnorr signature.</em></span> In order to generate a valid Schnorr signature, the value k cannot be null or zero. If the value is null, an attacker can detect this and know the value of the key used to sign. If the value k is zero, then the value of the result is independent of the key and invalid. Checks needed to be added to the Schnorr signature to verify that the value k is not null or zero.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Failures in input size validation during (de)serialization.</em></span> A serialization error could allow an attacker to allocate up to 4GB of memory by initializing a value of 0 for nbp. Consequently, this can lead to memory being allocated for partially completed containers.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Failures in input type validation during (de)serialization.</em></span> A lack of robust checking for input type error from untrusted sources can lead to undesired behavior and error states.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Twenty other recommendations to improve security, robustness, practices, and performance.</em></span> The team also made a number of recommendations to code practices to improve the robustness of Monero code, to optimize performance, to improve error handling, and to reduce the attack surface of the software.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kudelski found that the code was largely clean and that the C implementation that Monero has developed from the original Java code is suitable for use. Their findings did include 4 low severity bugs that have been patched, as well as a number of informational issues.</p>

<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-001: Unsafe use of environment variables</span><br />
Patch: This function no longer uses environment variables to set this value, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in commit 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-002: Lack of input validation in prover</span><br />
Patch: Input scalars are now checked to ensure they are within the proper range in the prove and verify routines, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-003: Integer overflow in bulletproof L size computation</span><br />
Patch: Correct boundary checks have been added to avoid the overflow, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in commit 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-O-008: Undefined behavior shifting signed value</span><br />
Patch: The function has been rewritten using a ternary operator in <span style="color: #28cc57;">commit 68f7606</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with updates to the bulletproofs code which fixes all of the high priority concerns.</p>
<p>This is the first of two audits that are sponsored by <a href="https://lab.getmonero.org/">Monero Research Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/">The Monero Community</a>, <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>, and <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a>. The second audit of Bulletproofs is being done by <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/en/">QuarksLab</a> and the results will be released in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>OSTIF is Working with Monero Research Lab on Bulletproofs</h1>
<p>We are happy to announce that we have been working with the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a></span> project to help them locate auditing resources for Bulletproofs. This code review is to evaluate the safety of the implementation of Bulletproofs into Monero, which promises to dramatically reduce transaction sizes for Monero, which will substantially reduce transaction fees, processing times and the size of the actual blockchain.</p>
<p>We have been working with two companies, <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">QuarksLab</span></a> in Paris and <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">X41 D-Sec</span></a> in Berlin to produce Statement of Work proposals and ensure that this review can be conducted entirely in public view and transparently. This allows everyone to view the final reports and see that the work was completed thoroughly and with significant oversight.</p>
<p>On top of assisting <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://lab.getmonero.org/">Monero Research Lab</a></span> with locating auditors willing to work in public, OSTIF is also assisting with financial resource issues, offering to accept Monero XMR and paying out the auditors in EUR to facilitate their participation.</p>
<p>The Monero community is in the process of selecting which teams will be conducting the review now.</p>
<p>You can participate in the discussion:</p>
<p>Here on Reddit: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/817zt0/mrl_bulletproof_audit_ffs_request/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/817zt0/mrl_bulletproof_audit_ffs_request/</a></span></p>
<p>Or here on Monero&#8217;s forums: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://forum.getmonero.org/7/open-tasks/89993/bulletproofs-audit">https://forum.getmonero.org/7/open-tasks/89993/bulletproofs-audit</a></span></p>
<h2>The next step for selecting auditors:</h2>
<p>Monero will create an FFS &#8211; a post on their Forum Funding System here:<br />
<a href="https://forum.getmonero.org/8/funding-required"><span style="color: #0000ff;">https://forum.getmonero.org/8/funding-required</span></a></p>
<p>On the FFS, anyone can donate Monero XMR to support the project. Once funded, the project proceeds and the auditors conduct their work.</p>

<p><a href="https://getmonero.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Monero</span></a> is a fully open-source and decentralized cryptocurrency that improves on the privacy shortcomings of Bitcoin through obfuscation technologies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3AHp9KgTkQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">RingCT</span></a> and is currently working on an i2p based routing system to further privatize transactions, called <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/kovri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Kovri</span></a>.</p>
<p>The Monero project has been instrumental in improving on privacy weaknesses in traditional cryptocurrencies, and they have had strong development progress and incident response.</p>
<p>Our Monero donation information will appear on the <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff;">donate page</span></a> in the coming days.</p>
