The multi-phased engagement, sponsored by Google, focused first on the triaging and closing of bugs, then upon further improving the core fuzzers that continually monitor for security issues using OSS-Fuzz infrastructure at </span><a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz."><span style="font-weight: 400">https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> This engagement is part of a series of security efforts to improve the security and reliability of Envoy. Earlier efforts include the </span><a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_envoy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">2018 Audit of Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by </span><a href="https://cure53.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cure53</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ada Logics</span></a> <a href="https://blog.envoyproxy.io/a-stroll-down-fuzzer-optimisation-lane-and-why-instrumentation-policies-matter-f0012ec260b3"><span style="font-weight: 400">fuzzing infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> work</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase I of the engagement was designed to help the Envoy Team reduce the number of open bugs identified, reduce noise in the existing fuzzers (so the Envoy team spends less time triaging non-issues), and improve fuzzing coverage where possible. OSTIF sourced four senior security experts from X41 D-sec to complete the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result of Phase I was the fixing of 68 security bugs. Furthermore, two critical vulnerabilities were found and proactively fixed. At the beginning of the Phase I engagement, there were 76 Total Fuzz Issues. As fixes and improvements were implemented, new fuzz issues were identified for analysis, allowing for further iteration and fine-tuning. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> <strong>Figure 1: Total Fuzz Issues vs Fixed at end of Phase I </strong></span><strong>(Sept, 2022)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase II was focused on improving the number of executions/second and high signal to noise ratio produced by the fuzzers. Additionally to triaging remaining open high priority fuzzers from Phase I, there was an effort to close another 10 health check related fuzz issues. In order to cover more code faster, while remaining highly efficient and controlling output, X41 was able to analyze bugs from the first phase to determine how the fuzzers were running tests and where they were losing speed and validity. Of Envoy’s original 67 fuzzers, 19 were considered high priority due </span><span style="font-weight: 400">to testing code paths that are exposed to potential attack vectors; by dataplane traffic in the form of QoDs and bugs that can impact reliability and security of Envoy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Because Envoy is also offered as a service, fuzz testing and hardening the configuration interface is crucial.  When fuzzers work on data and configurations simultaneously, there can be a tendency for them to move away from configurations that need deeper testing. This results in less code coverage. Envoy’s code base uses debug assertions, which further slowed down the testing process and often returned noise. To combat and remediate these multiple consequences, X41’s team developed a plan. First, create a way to generate valid configuration files by introspecting the configuration description already augmented by expressions supplying context, and then develop a two-step fuzzing process with the configuration files generated then used for fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The team of Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild and Dr. Robert Femmer had to develop a way to address the set of points they identified as limiting the fuzzers functionality. They aimed to improve the critical fuzzers that run on HTTP decoders and stream management, specifically HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and the HTTP/3 codec interfaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Vehreschild and Dr. Femmer not only developed four new fuzzers, but improved the overall security testing environment of Envoy instrumentally. The created fuzzers targeted HTTP decoders for high throughput focused on primary attack surfaces of Http1 (Balsa and http_parser), Http2 (nghttp2 and oghttp2), and Http3 Quic. To address the issues around configuration files, the team experimented with running configurations repeatedly to explore the data plane deeper before generating another configuration. Configurations found could increase fuzzing speed by a factor of 4 to 20 times. Further work resulted in removing debug assertions and reducing the binary size of fuzzers by a factor of 1.5. By developing ways to create valid and long-running configurations across the configuration and data planes, the performance of fuzzers was increased by a factor of 40. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The graph below strongly suggests that, since </span>March 2022<span style="font-weight: 400"> when Phase I of the engagement began, there has been a downward trend in generation of new fuzz issues due to this collective effort. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work took months to complete and was an open discussion-based project that allowed for all members to collaborate, help each other, and discuss the possibilities and testing done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We sincerely thank Kirtimaan Rajshiva, Adi Peleg, Yan Avlasov, Harvey Tuch, Joshua Marantz, and the entire Envoy Platform Team for funding and guiding this effort along with Markus Vervier, Eric Sesterhenn, Dr. Andre Vehreschild, Dr. Robert Femmer, and Sofie Seuren of X41 D-Sec for their diligent work and insight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate and improve security posture for the betterment of FOSS. We would also like to recognize Google, without whose funding this project would not have been possible.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.crossplane.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Crossplane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> underwent a successful third party security audit by </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the support of Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF). Used by firms such as JP Morgan, Time Warner, and MIT Lincoln Lab, the project is considered Incubating at </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/crossplane/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Over the first half of 2023, the multi-cloud control plane for Kubernetes API was examined, reviewed, and tested before its v 1.13 release with fixes from this audit. With the ultimate goal of graduation in mind, the audit team had its work cut out for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A holistic, comprehensive audit of Core Crossplane and Crossplane Runtime repositories was performed by manual code auditing, a fuzzing suite review, the creation of a threat model, and a </span><a href="https://slsa.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400">SLSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> grade. As the threat model was built, the audit team was able to determine attack surfaces and pinch points to focus upon which directed the manual code review. For example, supply chain security issues that Crossplane experiences as an image and package manager exposes the project to the potential for threat actors to introduce supply chain attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fuzzing being performed in Crossplane (by thirteen fuzzers ADA Logics </span><a href="https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/security/ADA-fuzzing-audit-22.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">previously created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for the project!) is critical to the ongoing, continuous monitoring of the security, health, and environment of the code. An additional four fuzzers were added during this audit with an additional fuzzer improved by way of increased code coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of the sixteen issues identified during the audit, fifteen were resolved by the Crossplane. This includes two CVEs that were found during the audit. First, a high severity finding that could allow image tampering was issued as CVE-2023-38495, and second, a low severity Denial-of-Service finding labeled CVE-2023-37900. In summation, 7 low, 8 medium, and 1 high finding were reported. The singular unfixed issue is located in the alpha features of Crossplane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are so grateful to the Crossplane team for their contributions, fixes, and investment in this audit’s execution. Further thanks to ADA Logics for their report and hard work on this project with us. It’s always a pleasure to collaborate with you. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to CNCF for their financial support of this audit and ongoing open source security work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF), </span><a href="https://k9mail.app/"><span style="font-weight: 400">K-9 Mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://7asecurity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">7ASecurity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> collaborated on a security audit of the Mozilla K-9 email application. K-9 is an open source email application and runs on most Android phone systems. Ideally, the application is reliable, intuitive, and secure to use. Not only critical to Android products, K-9 mail is popular as a project on Github and with non-contributing users. Many people therefore have a vested interest in the security health of this application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The assigned team of six auditors used whitebox methods for this audit. The scope of the audit consisted of multiple aspects including threat modeling, fuzzing, and supply chain analysis. A thorough review to identify, test, and remediate as many security issues as possible within scope was 7ASecurity’s stated goal. They combed through the code, and adjusted focus as the project led them. The final report linked below includes details of the work; such as implementing ossfuzz fuzzers along with semgrep and CodeQL rules, as well as how the team responded to the updated SLSA framework released during the 46 person day engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncovered during the security audit were seven medium and three low risk vulnerabilities, along with nine miscellaneous hardening recommendations. Of the 19 total issues, the K-9 Mail team fixed nine and partially resolved two more. By following the recommendations of the report, K-9 Mail can grow its security posture as it begins to become Thunderbird for Android. It has an incredible foundation to begin this new chapter with, as the report notes seven wide-ranging points of secure and healthy practices and conditions of K-9 Mail they saw evidenced during the engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The K-9 team did an exceptional job communicating and sharing information that allowed 7ASecurity to perform as comprehensive an audit as possible. Our gratitude to Christian Ketterer, Lisa McCormack, Ryan Sipes, Wolf-Martell Montwé and the rest of the K-9 Mail team. And to 7ASecurity, particularly Abraham Aranguren, Dariusz Jastrzębski, Daniel Ortiz, Dr. Miroslav Štampar, Óscar Martínez, and Patrick Ventuzelo- thank you for your hard work. We are thankful as well to our sponsor, </span><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mozilla</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, for their support of K-9’s current and future security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;OSTIF has a strong understanding of how open source projects operate and we really appreciated that they were able to jump in and help us coordinate an audit of the K-9 Mail software. OSTIF were great partners that made the process of doing the audit a breeze and provided a helpful guiding hand. We really appreciated their professionalism and expertise. I can confidently say that we plan on working with OSTIF again. &#8220;</span></p>

Equinox P2 is a provisioning platform, started by IBM in 2001. The Eclipse Foundation was founded three years later to act as an open, non-for-profit leader of the Eclipse Project community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF was contacted by the Foundation, with </span><a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2022/06/20/openssf-funds-python-and-eclipse-foundations-and-acquires-sos-dev-through-alpha-omega-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400">funding from OpenSSF project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, to perform a security audit and provide recommendations for security hardening. With Include Security, the audit resulted in a developed threat model, code review, and analysis of SAST and fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Include Security team followed a static code analysis with white-box code review methodology throughout the engagement. The result was one critical, three medium, and five low-risk findings. For the threat model, the focal point was on feasibly applicable threat actors to PGP-based signature verification. Everything else was considered out of the scope of the audit. In a methodical practice, Include created a threat model of the Target of Evaluation after a four step system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the 22 person days spent on the audit, Include Security also worked on SAST tooling and fuzzing for continuous monitoring. In the report, Include Security offers three security tools and recommendations of how fuzzing and SAST tooling could be reworked to best run on P2’s code. This would be mainly by adding rules to scanners to eliminate noise and false positives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF would like to extend our gratitude to the Equinox P2 team and the Eclipse Foundation for their participation and partnership in this security audit, particularly Mikael Barbero and Marta Rybczynska. Thank you as well to those at Include Security, for their hard work and final report on this project. Finally, we would like to acknowledge and thank OpenSSF </span><a href="https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for their financial support of this critical security work. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400">X-41 DSec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and OSTIF collaborated in May of 2023 on a source code audit of </span><a href="https://libjpeg-turbo.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">libjpeg-turbo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the accelerated JPEG image decoding software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audit’s emphasis was on reviewing input validation, memory management practices, and analysis of previously reported bugs. Using dynamic, static, and manual code testing, the audit team analyzed and tested libjpeg-turbo’s source code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Documented </span><a href="https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/3.0.0"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are the fixes of all three disclosed vulnerabilities and further changes released on 2023-07-03 with version 3.0.0 of libjpeg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A big thank you to </span><a href="https://github.com/dcommander"><span style="font-weight: 400">DRC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for implementing the fixes. Per the project’s </span><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/libjpeg-turbo"><span style="font-weight: 400">github sponsorship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> page, “libjpeg-turbo is one of the few pieces of critical IT infrastructure that is sustained solely through patronage and funded development.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">X41 noted the libjpeg-turbo library was healthy and following best practices, and recommends further testing on the popular project to minimize and prevent current and future security vulnerabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special thanks to the X-41 team along with </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">AWS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for funding this audit!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the Spring of 2023, OSTIF, </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://notaryproject.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Notary Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> collaborated on a security audit of the new Notation libraries. </span><a href="https://github.com/notaryproject/notation"><span style="font-weight: 400">Notation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a CLI project to add signatures as standard items in the registry ecosystem and to build a set of simple tooling for signing and verifying signatures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven issues were found by the audit team and remediated by the Notary Project team. A single high vulnerability identified during the engagement allowed unverified descriptors to be fetched from a remote registry. This was classified as </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33959"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33959</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Such an action could allow a malicious actor to sign or verify an artifact that could fool a user into using a malicious artifact. A solution was devised by using the library to validate descriptors as being provided by the user. Three issues (two medium and one low) were related to signature processing, using endless data attacks to cause resource exhaustion that could lead to denial of service. See </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33957"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33957</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33958"><span style="font-weight: 400">CVE-2023-33958</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for more details. The fix for these scenarios was uncomplicated, and can even be modified by users should it be necessary for their use of the library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The CVEs linked above were issued for three of the seven findings, and the other four received documentation to track them or CLI command flag name changes. These resolutions are in place in subsequent releases including RC-7 and 1.0.0 of Notary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Notary Project team was eager and reactive to solving reported issues, and as a result their development and release processes were tested and improved. Thank you particularly to Feynman Zhou, Junjie Gao, Pritesh Bandi, Patrick Zheng, Samir Kakkar, Shiwei Zhang, Toddy Mladenov, Vani Rao, and Yi Zha for their involvement in this audit. ADA Logics created and imparted wonderful work with this audit and report, and we are thankful to them for their part. Finally, OSTIF would like to offer our gratitude to </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for their financial support of work like this and other efforts that improve open source security. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) is thrilled to announce the results of security improvements via improved fuzzing capabilities on the </span><a href="https://liblouis.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Liblouis project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by ADA Logics! Liblouis is a braille translator with expansive capabilities that runs on open source code. In 2021, the project onboarded to OSS-Fuzz to perform ongoing security testing, but the code coverage was initially low. OSTIF and ADA Logics saw an opportunity to improve a project centered around accessibility, and armed with the knowledge and ability to contribute impactful security work to Liblouis, the project moved ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">David and Adam Korczynski of </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">ADA Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> contributed two fuzzers and a fuzzing dictionary to the project. First of the two fuzzers addressed the input translation, and this fuzzers ability to work across diverse input is pivotal. The second fuzzer acts similarly to the first, just that it executes back translation instead of the forward translation of the other fuzzer. The dictionary, which is for both new fuzzers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">captures all of the Opcode names used for translation table construction. Just the introduction of this dictionary caused a 45% increase in code coverage the day it was implemented. In total, code coverage went from around 20% to just below 80%; with static reachability peaking at 93%, an increase of 16% from the start of engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The data, found via the ADA Logics link below, was generated and analyzed using the Introspector, an insightful tool for visualizing OSS Fuzz setups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six issues were found by these fuzzers due to improved performance and code coverage. ADA Logics expects more to come as the fuzzers continuously run, providing hardened security outcomes to protect the users of Liblouis. David and Adam included further testing area recommendations in their work for maintainers to continue improving security measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work was organized, researched, and completed not for compensation, but out of love of the community and in fulfilling a mission to improve security posture for open source projects. Open source is maintained for all, and support can and should be rendered for programs that promote inclusivity and access for all.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In collaboration with </span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://in-toto.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-toto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, OSTIF is pleased to announce the publication of our audit of in-toto’s source code. In-toto, which has implementations in Python and Go, is a framework software for supply chain security. Integrating security and transparency through the entire process of application, in-toto’s holistic view of supply chain security is admired by us at OSTIF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using manual review (aided with differing static code analyzers for the respective code languages), X41 D-sec team identified 1 High, 4 Medium, and 3 Low severity vulnerabilities. In-toto’s source code is foundationally strong, and reviewed all in-scope code in the designated audit period. Furthermore, X41’s team took measures to help improve the overall security posture of in-toto’s code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the eight vulnerabilities, the most critical could compromise the security chain all the way to final verification. In the Python implementation, multiple vulnerabilities were associated with data verification signed with PGP keys in the layout file imported from GnuPG. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We extend our gratitude to the in-toto team, CNCF for their funding and support of this audit, and especially X-41DSec for their dedication and hard work on this audit. </span></p>
<p>The full report for the in-toto audit can be found here: <a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/X41-in-toto-Audit-2023-Final-Report-PUBLIC.pdf">https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/X41-in-toto-Audit-2023-Final-Report-PUBLIC.pdf</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF,</span><a href="https://x41-dsec.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> X41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://c-ares.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c-ares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coordinated on a security audit of c-ares’s source code in spring of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C-ares is a library written in C for asynchronous DNS requests, which runs on such applications as Microsoft Windows, Netware, and Android. It was developed at MIT, when a group expanded upon the capabilities of the ares library and licensed c-ares in 1998. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This audit was a well ordered and educational experience for the OSTIF team. While we hope this report will reach those who are able to best benefit from documented FOSS security audits, we know that the work itself will reach all those who depend on c-ares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, X41 found the c-ares library to be well designed and implemented. The audit found six inconsistencies during the process. Three vulnerabilities were rated as medium, three others as informational. Alongside performing static manual code review, the X41 team implemented and customized AFL++ fuzzers during this audit. Recently, AFL++ fuzzers have been made to support command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing, which was important to this audit as c-ares is made up of multiple CLI tooling components in its code base. While the audit particularly focused on memory corruption vulnerabilities which are common in C libraries, two of the medium vulnerabilities were categorized as </span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CWE 330</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Use of Insufficiently Random Values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so grateful to the c-ares team, particularly their </span><a href="https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/releases"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine contributors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as X41’s fantastic staff for their efforts on this project. </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored this work and we are deeply appreciative of their support of open source security.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>“Generally speaking, OSTIF as well as the maintainers of the library deserve a lot of praise for their overall support and assistance. It was a pleasure for the testing team working with them.”</strong></span></p>
<p>-from the X41 Team on c-ares</p></blockquote>
<p>The full audit report is here: <a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OSTIF-X41-c-ares-audit-2023-public-final.pdf">https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OSTIF-X41-c-ares-audit-2023-public-final.pdf</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falco joins a </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/03/13/an-overview-of-the-cncf-and-ostif-impact-report-for-the-second-half-of-2022-and-early-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing number of CNCF Projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that completed a third-party security audit organized by OSTIF. A follow up to their </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/audits/SECURITY_AUDIT_2019_07.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Falco project requested a new engagement due to changes in the code base since. OSTIF partnered with </span><a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarkslab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to complete the audit. An overview of the results along with a link to the report can be found below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Security audits are a good practice for projects especially as their communities and users grow. The <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/05/18/cloud-native-maturity-model-2-0/">CNCF maturity model</a> is a good example of using policy and a strong support network to help projects improve their security posture. It’s an especially good practice to do follow-on audits as projects implement new code and features. I commend the Falco team for their efforts and commitment.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director of OSTIF. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Falco community is composed of information security experts that are passionate and committed to making all aspects of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secure as possible at every level. It has been a pleasure working with OSTIF and Quarkslab to not only assess the current level of security but to also design the most effective strategies to continuously verify and improve the security properties of the project. We are especially impressed by the depth and quality of the analysis performed and the clear and smooth communication </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luca Guerra, Falco Core Maintainer, Open Source Engineer at Sysdig</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As found in the report, “The goal of the audit was to assist the Falco maintainers to increase their security posture using static and dynamic analysis. Falco maintainers required an emphasis on fuzzing. To that end, Quarkslab’s engineers researched multiple topics to provide recommendations and relevant advice. In addition, Quarkslab’s engineers assessed the code in order to find some issues, using automated testing tools, fuzzing, or just by manually reviewing the code base.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engagement included a threat model along with Static and Dynamic analysis and mainly uncovered 1 Medium and a number of low and informational findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reviewing the report findings, Falco maintainers and contributors worked to address all the issues identified, enhance static and dynamic analysis pipelines and track longer term tasks. The overall goal is to establish continuous improvement projects to maintain the highest security standards in the codebase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Falco release team that worked on the </span><a href="https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-34-0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34.0 release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-34-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34.1 patch release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on Falco Libraries 0.10.3 and 0.10.4 addressed all medium and low severity findings, along with informational findings as well. Details on the issues, credits, patches and affected versions are tracked in the relevant </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/security/advisories"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repository’s Security Advisories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuously assessing the security of the codebase and making sure that potential weak points are caught and fixed early in the development process is extremely important for Falco maintainers and contributors; according to the report recommendations the static and dynamic analysis steps automatically performed have been enhanced, with more additions planned. For instance:</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/93ae6bb6098e7563f94738839715c2d7ee8f5ab5/.github/workflows/staticanalysis.yaml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CppCheck has been added</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Falco repository alongside other static analysis tools already present;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/tree/master/semgrep"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semgrep has been added</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Falco Libs repository to prevent potentially dangerous functions from being introduced by contributors and enable more security focused checks in the future;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of AddressSanitizer, LeakSanitizer and similar tools </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/blob/33b2337c384b608049c8d619698396bd706ad98b/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L283"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been extended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to end to end testing to further improve memory leak, memory corruption, and error detection.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Falco community is also </span><a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/issues/979"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new ideas for more ways to integrate additional static analysis, memory leak, and memory error detection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falco maintainers have also greatly appreciated the work that the Quarkslab team has done on fuzzing and dynamic analysis. The report reveals that building a robust fuzzer for Falco is a challenging task, and the Falco community intends to work on it based on the expertise shared in the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank Leonardo Grasso, Jason Dellaluce, Luca Guerra, and the rest of the Falco team for contributing time to collaborate with the audit team. Furthermore a big thank you to Mahé Tardy, Laurent Laubin, Victor Houal, and Ramtine Tofighi Shirazi for their diligent work.</span></p>
