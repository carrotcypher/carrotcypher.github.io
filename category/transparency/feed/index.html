Equinox P2 is a provisioning platform, started by IBM in 2001. The Eclipse Foundation was founded three years later to act as an open, non-for-profit leader of the Eclipse Project community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF was contacted by the Foundation, with </span><a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2022/06/20/openssf-funds-python-and-eclipse-foundations-and-acquires-sos-dev-through-alpha-omega-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400">funding from OpenSSF project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, to perform a security audit and provide recommendations for security hardening. With Include Security, the audit resulted in a developed threat model, code review, and analysis of SAST and fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Include Security team followed a static code analysis with white-box code review methodology throughout the engagement. The result was one critical, three medium, and five low-risk findings. For the threat model, the focal point was on feasibly applicable threat actors to PGP-based signature verification. Everything else was considered out of the scope of the audit. In a methodical practice, Include created a threat model of the Target of Evaluation after a four step system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the 22 person days spent on the audit, Include Security also worked on SAST tooling and fuzzing for continuous monitoring. In the report, Include Security offers three security tools and recommendations of how fuzzing and SAST tooling could be reworked to best run on P2’s code. This would be mainly by adding rules to scanners to eliminate noise and false positives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF would like to extend our gratitude to the Equinox P2 team and the Eclipse Foundation for their participation and partnership in this security audit, particularly Mikael Barbero and Marta Rybczynska. Thank you as well to those at Include Security, for their hard work and final report on this project. Finally, we would like to acknowledge and thank OpenSSF </span><a href="https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for their financial support of this critical security work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>The Cloud Native Computing Foundation and OSTIF Impact Report</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF has been working with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) on a number of security projects over the last year. This has been a large collaborative effort to help CNCF projects improve their security posture by conducting code audits, building security tools, directing supply chain reviews, building fixes, and assisting projects with unique challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This report showcases the impact of our works on seven different projects (Argo, Backstage, Containerd, CRI-O, Envoy, Flux, KubeEdge). We also have eight projects with the CNCF in progress or scheduled for the remainder of 2022 that are not included in the scope of this report. Additionally, the project with Envoy is ongoing and is expected to continue to garner significant additional security progress.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Material Progress</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This partnership arose from the need for the CNCF to find a security partner that can readily work with open source projects to support their development in an impactful way. OSTIF&#8217;s tireless work in this area to build partnerships with security firms that understand open source, and our systems that deliver strong results while maintaining full transparency was a perfect match. In this report we show that we meet every challenge and bring real tangible improvements to the open source ecosystem.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OSTIF is simultaneously working on multiple projects this quarter. Here is what we&#8217;ve been working on and what to expect over the next few months!</p>
<h2>Two projects with the Linux Foundation</h2>
<p>We are working with the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a> on the safety and security of the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux Kernel</a>. We are working with Atredis Partners on evaluating the processes and policies for the Kernel&#8217;s security reporting, update, and disclosure processes to seek potential areas of improvement. This is something that the Kernel team has sought to review for years and OSTIF worked with our network of partners to bring the best people to the table for the task. We will be keeping the public notified as this project progresses. Here is an excellent talk by Konstantin Ryabitsev on how the Linux Kernel currently receives updates: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vohrz14S6JE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vohrz14S6JE</a></p>
<p>Additionally, we are in the early stages of reviewing the handling of software signing keys for the kernel, and how they are used for signing updates to the Kernel. We will have more information about this project in the near future.</p>
<h2>Two Projects with the Monero Community</h2>
<p>We are working with the Monero community on CLSAG. CLSAG promises to reduce signature sizes considerably while maintaining the same privacy level that Monero currently enjoys. Jean-Philipe Aumasson and Antony Vennard of <a href="https://teserakt.io/">Teserakt</a> will be reviewing both the theoretical paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654.pdf">here</a> and the implementation <a href="https://github.com/SarangNoether/monero/tree/clsag-device">here</a> after approval by the security committee and a round of fundraising with the Monero community.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are in the early stages of organizing and audit of Monero Triptych. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2020/018&amp;version=20200107:094009&amp;file=018.pdf">Triptych</a> promises to make transactions in Monero more efficient by increasing the efficiency of the ring signature scheme. Triptych allows Monero to significantly increase the size of rings while maintaining similar transaction sizes and verification speeds. This increase in ring size (from the current 12 to over 100) would theoretically substantially improve Monero privacy. We will be updating everyone on the status of this project as it progresses.</p>
<h2>Three VPN Related Projects</h2>
<p>We are working with the <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> team on a review of <a href="https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn">OpenVPN 2.5.0</a>, which introduces a number of new features that expand the use cases of OpenVPN. This includes and obfuscation plugin system that was developed with the <a href="https://operatorfoundation.org/">Operator Foundation</a>, whom we have also been working with to develop obfuscation plugins for OpenVPN that will be ready to go on launch.</p>
<p>We are also exploring scoping for a security review of <a href="https://wireguard.com">WireGuard&#8217;s</a> clients. This is crucially important because while WireGuard&#8217;s core code is only 5000-6000 lines and simple to review, the supporting software libraries for the individual clients adds an order of magnitude more code that doesn&#8217;t have the same brevity and quality controls of the core code. A wide-scope review of WireGuard gives the community a fine-grained review of the current security benefits of WireGuard over alternatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are exploring scoping to audit <a href="https://www.wintun.net/">WinTun</a>. WinTun is particularly important because it is the virtual driver that Windows requires for VPNs to function properly. This importance is magnified by WinTun also apparently performing better than tap-windows6 which is used by OpenVPN, and support for WinTun being added to OpenVPN. This means that WinTun will likely be the primary TAP/TUN driver for both OpenVPN and WireGuard in the future, so the security properties of WinTun are crucial.</p>
<h2>Reaching Out to RIOT.IM</h2>
<p>We have learned that the RIOT messenger team is seeking a security review of their project. So far we have been unsuccessful in our attempts to contact them. We will continue to try to reach out to assist the project and explore if collaboration is possible.</p>
<h2>Seeking Additional Sources of Funding</h2>
<p>OSTIF&#8217;s primary purpose is to bring together security resources with open source projects. As we expand on both ends of this goal, and we bring on more security teams while also having an increase in requests for support, the need for manpower grows. Two of our staff (Amir and Derek) have moved to working for OSTIF full-time.</p>
<p>Our efforts are now focused on seeking additional funding so that we can continue to effectively support projects with our time and resources. This comes in the form of us reaching out to more organizations for support, including large corporations and governments in the form of cybersecurity grants. Sponsorships and grants will be key for OSTIF going forward, as we continue to expand and magnify the amount of good we can do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/?p=1409&amp;preview=true">OSTIF CEO Derek Zimmer has left VikingVPN to join London Trust Media</a></h1>
<p>The founder of OSTIF has a new day job, working for London Trust Media as the Vice President of Marketing and Strategy.</p>
<p>This offer was made after years of working together with <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a> on the OSTIF project.</p>
<h2>What this means for OSTIF:</h2>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Effective immediately, Derek will no longer draw any bonuses or salary from OSTIF.</strong> This will allow us to put more resources toward marketing, outreach, office materials, and other budgets. Our commitment to being a 90%+ charity limits our ability to finance marketing and travel expenses. This will significantly add to those budgets going forward.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>The London Trust Media / Private Internet Access sponsorship of OSTIF is <em>likely to continue</em></strong>, meaning that we can far more done when we have a reliable recurring income from a sponsor.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Derek will be seen at a lot more community events like hacker and security conventions to talk about VPNs and OSTIF.</strong></p>
<p>We look forward to the future!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><b>2017 Financial Report for the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc.</b></h1>
<p>In 2017 OSTIF experienced substantial growth, and expanded our reach to multiple new areas of computing and software safety. We conducted an audit of OpenVPN 2.4.0 in partnership with QuarksLab and launched our bug bounty program.</p>
<p>This document is intended to inform our donors and the public about our operations and their related expenses. It is to show how our money is spent, and give ourselves a tool to evaluate how we are performing with regard to our goals and aspirations.</p>
<p><b>Let’s start with our fundraising:</b></p>
<p>Across 2017 we raised a total of <b>$201,009</b> which greatly exceeded our expenses of <b>$76,335 </b>and represented a 216% increase in revenue over FY2016.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p>OSTIF continues to grow rapidly as we expand our reach and bring more industry partners on board! With 2018 aimed at completing 4 major projects and bringing on over a dozen more projects for future support, we expect revenue and growth of our organization to continue to grow with the size of our community of developers and privacy advocates.</p>
<p><b>Expense breakdown and goals:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across 2015 and 2016 we spent a total of $76,355. These expenses are broken down into 5 categories. You can see the categories and their descriptions below:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charity</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are expenses that are related to our actual charitable activities. This spending is for auditing, bug bounties, and grants paid to projects that we support.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administrative Costs</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are costs like keeping the corporation and its nonprofit status registered with state and federal agencies.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is pay for our managers. Each manager does not draw a salary, but gets a bonus of 2% of the value of a fundraiser. This keeps our expenses low while still providing incentive to perform.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Costs</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes costs like consulting, web hosting, DDoS hardening, purchasing SSL certificates, and more.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotional Costs</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are small promotional costs for things like T-shirts and licensing for music/art for OSTIF guide videos.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Expense Breakdown:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1304" src="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pie-chart-comparison-2017-1024x427.png" alt="" width="780" height="325" srcset="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pie-chart-comparison-2017-1024x427.png 1024w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pie-chart-comparison-2017-300x125.png 300w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pie-chart-comparison-2017-768x320.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><strong>On the left we have our original targets and on the right we have our results.</strong></p>
<p>We have beaten our goals that were laid out in 2016! Our non-project spending totaled just $10,663, beating our 10% overhead target by a wide margin. <strong>This means that for FY2017 94.8% of our revenue has gone directly to helping open-source projects get stronger</strong> (or is unspent waiting for the next project). Technology costs remain our largest overhead expense, making up 1.9% of our expenses, and administrative costs have fallen substantially, making up only 0.1% of our expenses (down from 0.9%). The administrative decrease was expected as there were many one-time filing costs associated with establishing OSTIF as a corporate non-profit. We allocated small amounts to our budget for marketing, shooting a bumper video with our interns and doing some experimental targeted Twitter advertising. This made up 0.3% of our budget (up from 0%).</p>
<h2>Looking Forward to 2018:</h2>
<p>In 2018 we expect to again see substantial increases in contributions and results. This will be due to our track record encouraging the participation of larger donors and governments, as well as our continuously growing community. We want to complete at least 4 major projects in 2018 and will be preparing for another large expansion of supported apps for 2019.</p>
<p>We remain committed to our 90% efficiency target. We will continue to tightly control our expenses and <strong>keep costs low</strong>. We are proud to be among the most efficient charities of the world, and an increase in funding will only increase our performance per dollar.</p>
<p>I want to extend a special thank you <a href="http://privateinternetaccess.com">Private Internet Access</a>, <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ostif.org/top-ostif-donors/">all of our community supporters</a></span> who have helped make OSTIF a success. We look forward to working with the community to continue to create a safe internet for all of us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/?p=1205&amp;preview=true">OSTIF in 2018 &#8211; Our Plans for the Future</a></h1>
<p>2017 was a wild ride, with OSTIF raising roughly double the funds that we did the year prior. We&#8217;ve learned a lot along the way, and are working hard to get even more done in 2018. These plans include widening support to more apps, building stronger relationships with our existing supported apps, better messaging and outreach to donors, and getting our first &#8220;Gold&#8221; certified apps that have completed all three phases of OSTIF support (audit, bounties, research funding).</p>
<h2>Widening Support &#8211; More Open-Source Apps We Can Trust</h2>
<p>We are currently seeking to expand relationships to new projects in key areas of computing. Our strategy is to create a full &#8220;suite&#8221; of trusted apps that will allow a user to get through their day-to-day activity on safe, reliable, and trustworthy open source software. If you have an opinion on any of these projects we would love to hear from you on why one project should be selected over another. We value the input of the community and consider any and all comments from the public and our supporters.</p>
<p><strong>We need a web server</strong> &#8211; We are currently deciding between <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a></span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a></span>. While Apache has larger marketshare, Nginx is less resource hungry and has strong performance.</p>
<p><strong>We need a content management system</strong> &#8211; We are currently deciding between <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a></span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a></span>. WordPress has an overwhelming amount of marketshare, but also significant in-house support through Automattic and a less-than-perfect open source policy. Joomla is more open, but a much smaller project.</p>
<p><strong>We need a reliable open-source router OS</strong> &#8211; We are currently deciding between <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://dd-wrt.com/site/index">DD-WRT</a></span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://tomato.groov.pl/">Tomato</a></span>. DD-WRT is a larger project with a larger base of installed users, however, it is fragmented over many versions which makes reliable auditing difficult. The Shibby-Tomato project is smaller, supports less router hardware, and is basically a one man show for development, but is generally easier to use.</p>
<p><strong>We need a trustworthy BIOS / EFI system</strong> &#8211; We are currently deciding between the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.coreboot.org/">Coreboot</a></span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a></span> projects. Coreboot has virtualization support, while Libreboot has wider hardware support. We also want to fund additional research into breaking Intel Management Engine and the AMD Platform Security Processor that add unsafe and untrustworthy software to all BIOS/EFI implementations on newer computers.</p>
<p><strong>We need a trustworthy Media Player</strong> &#8211; This will almost certainly be <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.videolan.org/">VLC Media Player</a></span>. This is due to their massive install base, ease of use, performance, their commitment to remaining open-source, cost free, and ad-free, and their long standing track record.</p>
<p><strong>We need an open-source Office Suite</strong> &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a></span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a></span> are prime candidates for this. We need to do more research into both projects before making a decision.</p>
<p><strong>We need a database server</strong> &#8211; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.oracle.com/mysql/index.html">MySQL</a></span> is the prime candidate here, but <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a></span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://mariadb.com/">MariaDB</a></span> and others are also being considered.</p>
<p>This will expand OSTIF&#8217;s list of supported apps from the current five projects to twelve, significantly increasing our impact on the open-source community.</p>
<h2>Messaging and Outreach to Donors</h2>
<p>OSTIF will be increasing the ways that people can participate in the community and get involved. Since the organization was created, our greatest challenge has been developing contacts in the community and spreading our messaging. Over 90% of our manager&#8217;s time is spent on developing contacts and fundraising, and our limiting factors are time and word of mouth.</p>
<p>We have been considering ways that the community can help the project move forward. Our largest corporate sponsors have come from organic outreach. Someone who supported our cause suggested us to the right person in the right position at the right company. We want to maximize the way that the community can help us reach the right people.</p>
<p>To help us organize with the community to seek donors, <strong>we have created <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ostifoutreach/">/r/ostifoutreach on Reddit</a></span></strong>. This subreddit will allow us to directly name companies that we are trying to reach, and if someone knows a relevant contact at that company, they can either contact the person to let them know we&#8217;d like to reach them, or share that contact with us so that we can reach out ourselves.</p>
<p>We also plan to <strong>increase our presence on Twitter</strong> through <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://twitter.com/OSTIFofficial">@ostifofficial</a></span>. We will continue to offer significant security news, updates on OSTIF activity, and the occasional public praise, criticism or ridicule on tech-related topics.</p>
<p>We are considering <strong>live-stream sessions</strong> where people can interact with us directly to talk about security, strategy, current fundraisers, or whatever meandering off-topic thing the community wants to know.</p>
<p>And finally, we are considering <strong>a more formalized public comment system</strong>, where major policy choices can be formally posted for comment in the form of RFCs. This will allow us to organize community responses and understand what you want from us. We think this will be necessary as we grow to a size where the CEO can&#8217;t personally respond to every single comment.</p>
<h2>Gold Certified Apps</h2>
<p>With the OpenVPN and VeraCrypt projects completing their audits and having active bug bounties, they are well on their way to &#8220;Gold&#8221; certification, which is when OSTIF certifies the project as having met our requirements by going through an audit, 6 months of no new serious security problems while a $5000 bug bounty is active, and OSTIF has sponsored at least one research and development grant to make the software stronger or easier to use. We expect both projects to meet the standards for gold certification by the end of 2018.</p>
<h2>WE NEED YOU!</h2>
<p>With all of the progress we&#8217;ve made and how far we&#8217;ve come, it all falls apart without the community. We need your participation whether it is to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ostif.org/donate">donate</a></span>, subscribe to /r/ostifoutreach , follow us on Twitter, tell your friends and colleagues about us, comment to us about the direction of the organization or our supported apps, or audit our supported software and collect your bug bounty! We all need to participate to get over these challenges and make the free software world better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The OSTIF Public Books Have Been Updated &#8211; October 2017</h1>
<p>We have updated our 2017 Books to current, and they can be viewed here:   <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM"><span style="color: #0000ff;">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Highlights since the last major update of the books:</span></p>
<p>-Private Internet Access has become our first Platinum Sponsor. This means that they have committed to contributing $120,000 USD per year, and will be joining our steering committee, where they will participate in monthly meetings with us directly and help give us feedback and support on our projects.</p>
<p>-We have raised approximately $127,000 so far toward the <a href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenSSL 1.1.1 project</span></a>, putting us at about 30% of our goal after 10 days of fundraising. We anticipate having the project funded by the end of November if fundraising continues at our current pace.</p>
<p>-We paid a total of $5129 to Guido Vranken for finding 7 low to medium severity bugs in OpenVPN, and for helping to integrate the fuzzing tools that he created into the project, which helps permanently prevent these types of bugs from resurfacing in OpenVPN in the future.</p>
<p>-We purchased a BeagleBone Black for a future unannounced YouTube guide video.</p>
<p>-We spent $450 to have our closing bumper for our YouTube channel professionally filmed and recorded.</p>
<h3>We remain committed to maximum transparency about our operations and goals. All of this exists because of our support from the public. If you support our mission be sure to donate and spread the word about our mission to everyone you know. This dream depends on all of us to succeed. We can have a safer and more private internet.</h3>
