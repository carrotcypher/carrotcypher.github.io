										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is Vital for Vitess!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, in collaboration with </span><a href="https://adalogics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ada Logics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is proud to announce the results of a successful</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">security audit for </span><a href="https://vitess.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitess</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Born at Youtube in 2010 to help scale up database interactions, Vitess eventually moved under the umbrella of </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Native Computing Foundation,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graduating at CNCF in 2019. Used in over 50 projects, Vitess’s functions of scaling, workflow, and shard management are critical for growing applications that see thousands, sometimes millions, of users daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VTAdmin is a new aspect of Vitess, and as such the whole of the component was considered during this audit as an artifact for security review. During this audit Ada Logics ran with a five point list of goals, including manual code review, a threat model, improving Vitess’s fuzzing suite, and a </span><a href="http://slsa.dev/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grade.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the moderate vulnerabilities that were reported, two CVEs had the potential to allow malicious users to block other users from using the full capabilities of VTAdmin or Vitess. For example, stopping others from creating shards. Two of the fuzzers created by Ada Logics for Vitess were directly inspired by these two CVEs, and were immediately implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Described further in the report are details of VTAdmin’s attack surface, SLSA compliance, and all 12 vulnerabilities disclosed during the process of the audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF extends its deep gratitude to Deepthi Sigireddi and the entire Vitess Maintainer team as well as David Korczyzski and Adam Korczynski of Ada Logics.  Further thanks to CNCF for their gracious funding of this audit and continued work in open source security.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to report the results for the security audits of <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core">Jackson-Core</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind">Jackson-Databind</a>. Jackson-Core and Jackson-Databind are Java projects that are widely adopted for parsing and binding data. The security review was facilitated by <a href="https://ostif.org/">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> backed by the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a> and carried out by <a href="https://adalogics.com/">Adalogics</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project’s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. The Jackson team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by requesting independent review and actively participating in the audit process.</p>
<h2>Security Findings</h2>
<p>The results of the security audit are 12 security findings (3 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low/Informational). In addition, the team at Adalogics built 10 new fuzzers (4 for Jackson-core and 6 for Jackson-databind) which led to eight new bugs being discovered. These fuzzers will run on ossfuzz for Jackson before every release, giving Jackson a long-term security benefit.</p>
<p>The two most notable issues are <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42003">CVE-2022-42003</a> and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42004">CVE-2022-42004</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-42003 Resource Exhaustion via UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS</strong></p>
<p>An unchecked deserializer could be abused to exhaust resources via nesting arrays, causing a denial of service.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-42004 Resource Exhaustion via BeanDeserializer._deserializeFromArray</strong></p>
<p>An unchecked deserializer could be abused to exhaust resources via nesting arrays, causing a denial of service. This bug has a more limited impact because it requires specific settings to be manually enabled in order to be exploitable.</p>
<p>The remaining high severity issue was an edge case that Adalogics and the Jackson team assessed has no use cases that are exploitable.</p>
<p>All of the serious issues identified through this engagement have been fixed and validated by the Adalogics team. See below for the full report.</p>
<h2>Thank You</h2>
<p>A big thank you to the Open Software Security Foundation for supporting the work and funding the audit. Furthermore, thank you to the Adalogics team for executing the audit and working with us to make and validate fixes. Also, thank you to the <a href="https://sos.dev">Secure Open Source</a> initiative for helping to compensate the Jackson team for their extensive work improving these projects.</p>
<p>Also special thanks to Tatu Salorenta, Adam Korczynski, and David Korczynski for their roles in the engagement.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s Do More to Make Open Source Better</h2>
<p>Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Everyone around the world depends on OSS, and we would love to do more security audits! If you’re interested in financially supporting this work, contact <a href="mailto:amir@ostif.org">amir@ostif.org</a>.</p>
