										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Announcement: </span></p>
<h1><b>Google is partnering with Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc to sponsor security reviews of critical open source software. </b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is elated to announce that we are planning to improve security of eight open-source projects thanks to support from the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/">Google Open Source Security Team</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This marks a major success in bringing on large corporate donors to support OSTIF’s model of improving open source software through security reviews and source code audits. A focused, well-scoped review by an experienced team can drive significant and long-lasting improvements in widely used projects. For example, </span><a href="https://ostif.org/our-audit-of-unbound-dns-by-x41-d-sec-full-results/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF’s end-to-end review of Unbound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open-source Domain Name System (DNS) resolver used in securing websites, resulted in 48 changes that strengthened its security, including finding and patching one Critical, five High, and five Medium severity issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s support will allow OSTIF to launch the Managed Audit Program (MAP), which will expand our in-depth security reviews to even more projects vital to the open source ecosystem. Our initial list of </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oytKuD7UCX6nDXWQMr6ZgYYgap_SH_JVBof5gNrgSxo/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 MAP projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was identified empirically by research <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uahUIUa82J6WetAqtxCM_qgH-YJOagH84AFniIhlAbg">[ 1 ]</a>, <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf">[ 2 ]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00352.pdf">[ 3 ]</a> targeted at identifying the most critical digital infrastructure, and cross-referenced with </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenSSF’s Security Scorecards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prioritize projects within the list. Together, these efforts identified eight libraries, frameworks and apps that would benefit the most from security improvements and make the largest impact on the open-source ecosystem that relies on them. </span></p>
<h2><b>The Projects</b></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Git</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is the de facto version control software used in modern DevOps. According to the </span><a href="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/ossf-criticality-score/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Git is the second-most critical application in C and the 10th-most critical application across all platforms. In development since 2005, git makes up the foundation of </span><a href="https://github.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">github</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gitlab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is undoubtedly one of the most critical pieces of open-source software in the world. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lodash</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>, a modern JavaScript utility library with over 200 functions to facilitate web development, can be found in most environments that support JavaScript, which is most of the world wide web. Lodash is also used and tested in most current web browsers, including Chrome since v74. Lodash was chosen for security review due to ubiquity and project age, along with a relatively high </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 77%. The Linux Foundation &amp; The Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard’s study titled </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identified lodash as one of the most used packages according to dependency analysis. Furthermore, taking into account at least </span><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=20100&amp;product_id=57083&amp;version_id=0&amp;page=1&amp;hasexp=0&amp;opdos=0&amp;opec=0&amp;opov=0&amp;opcsrf=0&amp;opgpriv=0&amp;opsqli=0&amp;opxss=0&amp;opdirt=0&amp;opmemc=0&amp;ophttprs=0&amp;opbyp=0&amp;opfileinc=0&amp;opginf=0&amp;cvssscoremin=0&amp;cvssscoremax=0&amp;year=0&amp;cweid=0&amp;order=1&amp;trc=4&amp;sha=ec99d3827329b3d01f3412ca337b0d88dfbde6dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 reported vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 2018 and a </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 50%, it is reasonable to justify a Security Review and a boost to security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laravel</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> is a php web application framework that is used by many modern, full-stack web applications, including integrations with Google Cloud. Laravel was chosen for security review due to ubiquity and project age along with a relatively high </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 79%. Laravel has at least 9 reported vulnerabilities since 2017 and a </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 58%, making it a good candidate for Security Review and a boost to security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slf4j</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">Slf4j</a> is a logging facade for various Java logging frameworks. </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identified slf4j as one of most-used non-JavaScript packages according to dependency analysis. Factoring in the project age of 16 years and various vulnerability reports, such as </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8088"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CVE-2018-0088</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a detailed review would likely provide substantial improvement to its security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson-core &amp; Jackson-databind</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core">Jackson-core</a> is a JSON for Java, Streaming API, and extra shared components and the base the </span><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson data-bind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> package. Both projects were identified by </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the 1st and 2nd most-used non-JavaScript packages. With project ages of over 9 years and </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 42% and 58% respectively, it is reasonable to justify a review and a boost to security posture for these widely-used dependencies.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Httpcomponents-core &amp; Httpcomponents-client</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core and client components of <a href="https://hc.apache.org/">Apache httpcomponents</a>, these projects are responsible for creating and maintaining a toolset of low-level Java components focused on HTTP and associated protocols. Fundamental functions of the web, these projects were identified in the most widely used non-javascript packages. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Thank You</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to thank the Google Open Source Security Team for helping us scale our impact to not only find bugs but also fix issues across the open-source ecosystem. From here, we hope to significantly grow operations to support hundreds of projects in the coming few years. To reach this goal, we will need support from the communities that rely on this infrastructure, and improve our data to target the best projects for our work. In the end, we believe these combined efforts will lead to a safer open source environment for everyone.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ostif.org">OSTIF</a>, working with the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/monero">Monero Community</a>, the Monero development team, <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/">Monero Research Lab</a> and <a href="https://sweetwater.consulting/">Sweetwater Asset Consulting</a>, has completed our latest security review of Monero CLSAG.</p>

<p>Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signatures are a new variant of Monero&#8217;s current MLSAG (Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature) scheme. Overall, it promises to further reduce the size of Monero signatures while maintaining all of the privacy characteristics of Monero.</p>
<p>JP Aumasson and Antony Vennard conducted a two phase review of CLSAG. First, they reviewed the theoretical construction presented in the Monero CLSAG paper by Brandon Goodell, Sarang Noether, and Arthur Blue. The latest version is published here:  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/654.pdf</a> Second, they reviewed the code as it will be implemented in Monero to ensure that the implementation maintains the security properties that the paper establishes. Additionally, the CLSAG code was reviewed for general code errors that could lead to security issues.</p>
<p>Because of this audit, the foundational design of CLSAG has improved through improvements to the formal paper, and peer review has verified that the overall security of the scheme is reasonably sound and ready for live use.</p>
<h2><strong>Review of the CLSAG Paper</strong></h2>
<p>Proofs in cryptography are similar to proofs in mathematics, where security properties that are assumed must have prior work that confirms that the assumption made by the researchers is true. You build new ideas on these base assumptions to create something new and novel, and previous proofs support your novel construction&#8217;s claims be it for security, privacy, anonymity, unforgeability, or other functionality that you seek.  The findings from Jean-Philippe and Antony led to many improvements to the paper for academic rigor. This includes problems like unsupported security assumptions, readability issues,  and properly defining the definitions of terms. These are largely issues with an academic proof that would not affect the strength of CLSAG, however, the paper serves as a blueprint for building a novel signature scheme, and errors in proofs can lead to unforeseen weaknesses in the design and implementation phases of the code.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have a good confidence that the construction proposed satisfies the intended security goals, yet a moderate confidence that the proofs are entirely valid.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>After the edits to the CLSAG paper, the auditors are more confident that CLSAG has strong, valid, security proofs.</strong></span></p>
<p>Overall the team found that CLSAG is well constructed for its use-case in Monero. Some gaps were identified that may affect the overall security strength of the scheme, but the audit team found that the security is likely &#8220;strong enough&#8221; to thwart any attempts to break the signature scheme.</p>
<h2><strong>Review of the CLSAG Implementation in Monero</strong></h2>
<p>Monero CLSAG&#8217;s code was reviewed using both static and dynamic analysis, meaning JP and Antony both manually reviewed the code and used automated tools to search for additional potential problems (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cppcheck">cppCheck</a>, <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql">CodeQL</a>, and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/">clang-tidy</a>).</p>
<p>Overall, the team found no major issues with the implementation. Suggestions were made to improve the design in a future version of CLSAG, such as using built-in features of C++ to securely erase data from memory after its use.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Overall, we believe the code implements the CLSAG scheme as desired accurately and<br />
provides a high level security.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The audit team found that the code is clean, easy to read, and well designed. Additionally, the CLSAG code reuses well-tested and well-understood components in its design. Lastly, the code is also well commented for understanding error-handling. Being a C++ application, the authors recommend extending Monero&#8217;s current unit-testing and fuzzing to include CLSAG&#8217;s code to further check for general C++ problems like null pointer errors, bounds checking, memory handling, and error handling.</p>
<p>Only two recommendations were made by the reviewers:</p>
<h3>key struct misuse prevention</h3>
<p>The reviewers recommend an improved technique to ensure that secure memory erasure takes place after data is used and no longer required.</p>
<h3>Unnecessary code duplication</h3>
<p>There are two functions in CLSAG that perform nearly-identical functions and can be combined. This is to further simplify code as a best practice and does not impact security, privacy, or performance.</p>
<h2><strong>The CLSAG Audit Paper</strong></h2>
<p>As always, all of OSTIF&#8217;s sponsored research is available, in full, for free.
