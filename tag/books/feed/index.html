										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The OSTIF Public Books Have Been Updated &#8211; October 2017</h1>
<p>We have updated our 2017 Books to current, and they can be viewed here:   <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM"><span style="color: #0000ff;">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Highlights since the last major update of the books:</span></p>
<p>-Private Internet Access has become our first Platinum Sponsor. This means that they have committed to contributing $120,000 USD per year, and will be joining our steering committee, where they will participate in monthly meetings with us directly and help give us feedback and support on our projects.</p>
<p>-We have raised approximately $127,000 so far toward the <a href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenSSL 1.1.1 project</span></a>, putting us at about 30% of our goal after 10 days of fundraising. We anticipate having the project funded by the end of November if fundraising continues at our current pace.</p>
<p>-We paid a total of $5129 to Guido Vranken for finding 7 low to medium severity bugs in OpenVPN, and for helping to integrate the fuzzing tools that he created into the project, which helps permanently prevent these types of bugs from resurfacing in OpenVPN in the future.</p>
<p>-We purchased a BeagleBone Black for a future unannounced YouTube guide video.</p>
<p>-We spent $450 to have our closing bumper for our YouTube channel professionally filmed and recorded.</p>
<h3>We remain committed to maximum transparency about our operations and goals. All of this exists because of our support from the public. If you support our mission be sure to donate and spread the word about our mission to everyone you know. This dream depends on all of us to succeed. We can have a safer and more private internet.</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/ostifs-2017-books-have-been-updated/">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund&#8217;s Open Books for 2017</a></h1>
<p>We have been late to the party on updating our open books for 2017. I have gone through and updated them finally today.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqWBlNwk5be2c74cRlmYOdhLWPeCjCBAALxYCdMwIaM</a></p>
<h2>The big items of note:</h2>
<p>-The OpenVPN Fundraiser has concluded and we <strong>beat our goals by a comfortable margin</strong>. These excess funds are being reserved for the bug bounty program which we aim to have active by the end of the FY2017.</p>
<p>-Our Paypal donations have been moved into our general funds account.</p>
<p>-We have liquidated all of our Bitcoins for USD. We sold our Bitcoins on an exchange on February 26th at an exchange rate of $1202 : 1 BTC, giving us a nice boost over the value of the BTC donations when they were made in November and December 2016.</p>
<p>-Most of the liquidated BTC funds have been moved to the general funds account.</p>
<h2>Future Liabilities:</h2>
<p>-We still need to pay for the OpenVPN audit by QuarksLab upon its conclusion.</p>
<p>-We still need to pay for T-shirt printing related to the OpenVPN fundraiser. While the first rounds of shirts has been printed and shipped, they contain some subtle misprinting errors and will need to be re-printed and re-shipped. The printer has agreed to eat the cost of reprinting the shirts in exchange for us shouldering the cost of the re-shipping.</p>
<p>We are not expecting these liabilities to exceed $66,500 in total costs to OSTIF.</p>
<p>Keep checking with us for more updates!</p>
<p>-Derek</p>
