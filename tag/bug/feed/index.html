										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results of curl Security Audit </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By: Amir Montazery, OSTIF</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (</span><a href="https://ostif.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is thrilled to announce the results of a security audit and threat model for </span><a href="https://curl.se/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">curl</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In development since 1998, curl is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. Curl is used in just about everything: cars, television sets, routers, printers, audio equipment, mobile phones, tablets, media players and is the Internet transfer engine for thousands of software applications in over ten billion installations. It’s even </span><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/04/19/mars-2020-helicopter-contributor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deployed on Mars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security review of curl was facilitated by OSTIF and sponsored by the Open Source Security Foundation (</span><a href="https://openssf.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenSSF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) in an effort to improve the security of this critical project in the open source ecosystem. The engagement involved a team of four consultants conducting code review for approximately six engineer-weeks of effort. A total of 12 issues were addressed, including 2 High Severity findings. The technical work of the review was led by </span><a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications#security-reviews"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trail of Bits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bug fixes were validated and patched as part of the </span><a href="https://curl.se/dev/release-procedure.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">curl release schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The planned release for December 21, 2022, included all of the fixes and improvements made to curl as a result of this engagement. A detailed synopsis of the security improvements to curl can be found in the reports under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary of Findings </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fix Review Results</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another significant accomplishment from this engagement was a component-focused threat model for curl and libcurl. Published as a separate report, the effort involved a team of two engineers focused on the identification of security control flaws that could result in a compromise. This focused effort uncovered one design-level issue that could lead to vulnerabilities along with multiple security improvements. Threat model reports like this one can be used by developer and maintainer communities to better understand components, trust zones, and threat actors and gain a deeper understanding of how to use a project like curl. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The curl team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by actively participating in the audit process and collaborating with the audit team during the review and threat modeling exercise. Curl is a good example of a critical open source project. It has been in development for over 20 years thanks largely in part to </span><a href="https://www.haxx.se/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haxx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group of open source developers and hackers in Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is extremely grateful for the funding and support from OpenSSF to help make this critical project more secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results can be viewed in full detail at the following links: </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank David A. Wheeler, Brian Behlendorf, and Bob Callaway for helping to facilitate this work, and OpenSSF for funding this audit. OSTIF is planning more security efforts in 2023, and funding audits like these can be a useful tool for securing projects in open source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to Daniel Stenberg and Dan Fandrich of the curl project for actively participating in the security engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to everyone from Trail of Bits that did excellent work on this audit!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on this type of security work being done, visit the </span><a href="https://ostif.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We also have all of our published work on our <a href="https://github.com/Amir-Montazery/OSTIF/blob/main/Completed-Engagements.md">Github</a>. The OpenSSF supports work like these security audits to make open source software more secure. Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Everyone around the world depends on open source software (OSS), and security audits play an important role in securing the open source ecosystem. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TrueCrypt &#8211; The venerable full disk and container encryption software that was abandoned by its developers in 2014, was believed to be secure, despite the development of the software ending. This was the consensus among the security community because the software had been audited by iSec (a subsidiary of NCC). They had taken separate looks at the boot loader and the application code and not found any serious security flaws.</p>
<p>This strengthened the community&#8217;s trust in the software and people continued to use the software, confident that the software was largely bug-free.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and <a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Forshaw</a> from <a href="http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google&#8217;s Project Zero</a> has taken a look at the source code, and found two flaws that existed throughout the iSec audit. One is a critical EOP (escalation of privilege) bug that would allow an attacker to use the TrueCrypt application to get elevated access to a computer that has the software installed. While this would not give access to the containers on the Windows PC and the data would remain encrypted, it is only one additional step now to bypass that hurdle. You could, for example, install a keylogger on the machine and use that to get access to the passwords on the machine without the user&#8217;s knowledge, thus breaking the encryption of containers.</p>
<p><a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a> has patched the flaws, and the current version is now safe from the EOP attack. Make sure you update VeraCrypt to the current version if you haven&#8217;t already. If you are still running TrueCrypt, now is the time to run for the hills as this flaw is a deal-breaker. Having the TrueCrypt software installed is a direct security risk on all Windows systems.</p>
<p>This chain of events highlights the need for support from organizations like ours and people like you. You need as many eyes on critical security software as possible. Our efforts to draw more skilled developers into reviewing the code, both through <a href="https://ostif.org/security-audits-what-they-are-and-why-they-matter/">bounties</a> and <a href="https://ostif.org/security-audits-what-they-are-and-why-they-matter/">direct funding of audits</a>, is a crucial step in keeping software as secure as possible.</p>
<p>You can read more about the new flaws here: CVE-2015-7358 and CVE-2015-7359 (full disclosure has not occurred yet, this will be updated with links after full disclosure)</p>
