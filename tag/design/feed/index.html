										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After our successful fundraiser for <a href="https://ostif.org/the-openvpn-fundraiser-has-hit-its-goal-work-on-the-audit-begins/">OpenVPN</a>, we are now moving forward with getting shirts for our supporters printed and shipped out. You can see the designs <a href="https://ostif.org/ostif-t-shirts-available-to-donors/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We have sent emails out to our individual contributors that have made qualifying donations already. Check your emails! Some of you donated through anonymous methods where we could not respond to you. If you would like a shirt get in touch with us!</p>
<p>If you or your organization made a qualifying donation to us ($50 for US residents, +$5 for international shipping if you are not a US resident) send us an email with information about your donation, your shirt size (or sizes) and the address you would like them mailed to.</p>
<p>If you would like to make a last minute donation to qualify for a shirt, <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/">donate</a> and contact us quickly! Our next fundraiser will feature a different design!</p>
<p>The email address is below:</p>
