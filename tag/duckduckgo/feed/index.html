The charitable giving as part of DuckDuckGo’s annual program </span><a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/2022-duckduckgo-charitable-donations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread Privacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is special, as the funds are not allocated to any specific project. This contribution helps OSTIF tremendously and allows the organization to be more sustainable.

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duckduckgo</a>, the privacy search engine, has contributed to OSTIF for a second time by donating $25,000 USD. Their site that tracks their charitable donations <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/2021-duckduckgo-donations/">Spread Privacy</a> has the official announcement.</p>
<p>These funds are not allocated to any specific project, which helps OSTIF tremendously by allowing us to spend resources on overhead costs of doing business that the organization needs to spend money on to function. Most of our funding from corporate donors comes with specific projects in mind and doesn&#8217;t significantly help the core organization function.</p>
<p>Duckduckgo originally donated to OSTIF for <a href="https://ostif.org/the-veracrypt-audit-results/">our first project, VeraCrypt</a>, which helped prove that our concept worked and ultimately led to where we are today, nearly six years later. Their continued support shows their commitment to keeping the open source projects we rely on secure.</p>
<p>And a special thank you to Katie and Charlie for helping to make this happen!</p>

<h2>What are we working on?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a></span> powers everything. 70% of the top million websites use OpenSSL to provide encryption services to their visitors and to encrypt user information. It&#8217;s in thousands of apps, and the internet as we know it relies on OpenSSL to protect our information.</p>
<p>The NSA has tried to compromise OpenSSL before, by<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/01/14/hopefully-last-post-ill-ever-write-on/">introducing weakened standards</a> </span>and<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-rsa/exclusive-secret-contract-tied-nsa-and-security-industry-pioneer-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220">bribing companies to use those weakened components</a></span>.</p>
<p>OpenSSL is getting a major update with version 1.1.1, called<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.eweek.com/security/tls-1.3-encryption-standard-moves-forward-improving-internet-security">TLS 1.3</a>.</span> It is a new set of security standards and cryptography for the next generation of encryption. There&#8217;s a lot of new code, new options, and new features.</p>
<p>We need to publicly review this code to make sure that it is as safe as possible. Specific areas that the NSA has attacked before (the Pseudorandom Number Generator or PRNG) are getting big updates and need to be independently verified.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want another compromised PRNG, Heartbleed, Logjam, FREAK, or CCS Injection problem to slip through the cracks. We need to ensure that OpenSSL is safe for all of us to use long into the future.</p>
<p>For more technical details on the scope of the audit, look here: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/">https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/</a></span></p>
<p><strong>These projects do not happen without your support. Tell your friends. Spread the word. Donate. We need to build a safer internet together.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Double Your Donations With CrowdRise</h1>
<p>Today, we begin our second round of funding in partnership with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, who will be matching Crowdrise donations for the next four weeks!</p>
<p>You can view the Crowdrise campaign and donate here to have your donation matched (doubled): <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/">https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/ostif1/</a></p>
<h2>OpenSSL 1.1.1 Project Changes</h2>
<p>We have made changes to the proposed OpenSSL project to bring down costs while still allocating enough resources to ensure that a complete and thorough audit is completed.</p>
<p>The original plan was for all OpenSSL components in the scope to be reviewed by two separate teams, one at Kudelski and one at QuarksLab. This was costly and redundant work that greatly inflated the cost of the project and has delayed fundraising and completion.</p>
<p>To trim down costs, we have:</p>
<p>-Removed Kudelski as our secondary auditor (they were the higher of the two bids).</p>
<p>-Added Jean-Phillipe Aumasson specifically to review the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) changes.</p>
<p>-Removed overhead costs such as t-shirts and other giveaways that greatly inflate the costs of the fundraising.</p>
<p>These changes reduced our overall cost of the project substantially and our project fundraising goal is <strong>LESS THAN HALF</strong> of what it was originally.</p>
<p>We now only need to raise a total of $150,000 to meet our goal and fully fund the project. We are already over halfway there!</p>
<p>The goal on CrowdRise ($70000) represents the funds that we need to raise to complete the OpenSSL project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OSTIF is proud to announce that we have come to an agreement to fully fund an audit of VeraCrypt. Using funds that were donated by <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href="https://vikingvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VikingVPN</a>, we plan to hire <a href="http://quarkslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuarksLab</a> to go over the code and search for vulnerabilities and backdoors.</p>
<p><a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a> is a crucial piece of open-source software that can encrypt any storage medium with powerful and highly tamper-resistant encryption that greatly enhances the personal security of anyone that uses it. An audit of the code brings fresh professional perspectives and a deep analysis of the code to search for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>As of our agreement today, QuarksLab will be executing their auditing work in mid-August with completion and results before mid-September. The team has been instructed to give any results of this audit directly to the lead developer of VeraCrypt using heavily encrypted communications. This is to prevent their research from leaking zero-day vulnerabilities to the public, and so that the OSTIF does not have access to the results ahead of the public.</p>
<p>Once all parties are satisfied that any major vulnerabilities have been patched, we plan to post the results of this audit to all three of our websites (OSTIF.org, QuarksLab, and VeraCrypt) simultaneously.</p>
<p>This audit is very exciting for us, as it is the first time that we are converting promises and goals into results! We look forward to bringing the open-source community and the public closer together, and we are committed to fighting hard for the technical solution to the privacy problem.</p>
