<p>We are currently hosting a KickStarter project to help pay for a direct to garment printer that we can use to raise funds for all of our future fundraisers. This will allow us to give attractive gifts to our backers while raising money to enable the crucial security work that we do.</p>
<p>We have worked on this for months, making sure that we are compliant with the state of IL by getting resellers license and a tax ID, tons of business research on the real world costs of t-shirt printing as a business, probing shipping partnerships, and working with over a dozen artists to make our 40+ designs! We are also making custom engraved RFID-blocking wallets which we can laser engrave with a design of your choosing!</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to take a look at our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ostif/ostif-building-a-better-internet-with-shirts">awesome gallery of stuff we have put together on KickStarter</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is working with the Monero community to fund at least two (and probably three) audits of Monero RandomX.</p>
<h2>What is RandomX?</h2>
<p>RandomX is a project that implements a dynamic proof of work algorithm. The aim of an algorithm that changes is to make it difficult to design efficient circuitry that can fully automate the algorithm in an ASIC. The increased complexity of the algorithm makes it so that an ASIC would lose the advantages that it has over more traditional CPU/GPU designs that can execute many types of code and do many types of mathematics.</p>
<p>The goal of RandomX is to be a significant boost to ASIC resistance, which is seen as a hedge against centralization.</p>
<p>Monero (and some other cryptocurrencies) are fighting to overcome significant efforts to centralize mining under ASICs, because one of the fundamental components of cryptocurrency is that access to mining needs to be egalitarian, and custom ASIC designs place the lions&#8217; share of the processing power under the control of a few centralized entities, who then gain significant control over the blockchain.</p>
<p>The community has selected three auditors, and a fourth, <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a>, is also looking at the code through an independent group <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave.org</a>.</p>
<p>The auditors are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/">Kudelski Security</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41 D-Sec</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/en/">QuarksLab</a></p>
<p>You can read the actual proposals from each team here: <a href="https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits">https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits</a></p>
<p>The fundraising has been moving quickly, if you have some XMR that you&#8217;d like to contribute to the effort <a href="https://ccs.getmonero.org/projects/14/donate">you can pitch in here</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We have just completed our review of <a href="https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/">OpenSSL 1.1.1 with QuarksLab</a>, and we are moving on to our next big project, Unbound DNS!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />What is Unbound and Why is it Important?</h2>



<p>One of the core functions of the internet is domain name resolution. This means that when you type in a domain name like &#8220;ostif.org&#8221; into your browser, your computer asks a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name Server</a> (DNS Server) where OSTIF.org is, and that server returns an address to your browser so that it knows where to go to load the site. This same system is used in apps, operating systems, and every web-connected service.</p>



<p>The entire DNS system is decades old and was not originally designed with security or privacy in mind. This means that DNS was designed as &#8220;connectionless&#8221; and without encryption. This opens up DNS to all kinds of problem like <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/dns-reflection-attack/">DNS reflection attacks</a> (hijacking many DNS servers to knock down websites via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing">DNS Spoofing and DNS Poisoning</a> (an attacker intercepting your DNS requests and sending back malicious IP addresses), and wholesale surveillance (all DNS requests going through multiple parties on the web who can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_analytics">record every website you visit and every service you use</a>).</p>



<p>To fix this, standards have been developed to make DNS more trustworthy by encrypting the connections and verifying the data coming back from the servers is not from an interloper. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DNS over TLS</a> are the two major solutions used today.</p>



<p>The most popular open-source solution out there is <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> by <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/">NLNetLabs</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To help increase online privacy, Unbound supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858">DNS-over-TLS</a> which allows clients to encrypt their communication. In addition, it supports various modern standards that limit the amount of data exchanged with authoritative servers. These standards do not only improve privacy but also help making the DNS more robust. The most important are <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7816">Query Name Minimisation</a>, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8198">Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache</a> and support for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7706">authority zones</a>, which can be used to load a copy of the root zone.</p>
<cite>https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about</cite></blockquote>



<p>Not only is it widely used in many sites and services, but it is integrated into projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> that are increasing the security of the entire Internet through enabling widespread use of free security certificates for Domain Names. Let&#8217;s Encrypt serves over 150 million domain certificates that enable https on websites around the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Are We Collaborating?</h2>



<p>OSTIF and Unbound have been discussing their current security practices and potential improvements, as well as establishing secure communications with NLNetLabs for reporting issues. Now, we are raising money for a full security review of Unbound, which will be conducted with <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41-Dsec in Germany</a>. After all issues are resolved we will publish the audit report for the public to review, and then Unbound will join our bug-bounty program to bring white-hat hackers around the world in to do continuous review of the code and locate further issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much do we need to raise?</h2>



<p>We need to raise approximately <strong>$139,000</strong> in total to cover the cost of the audit, the pool of money for the bug bounty system, and various operations costs (transaction fees on donations, etc). These numbers come from the size of the code base, the complexity of the code, the quality of the documentation on how the app works, and the current security practices which influence the scope of the audit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW TO GET INVOLVED!</h2>



<p>You can donate to us through a huge number of easy options <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/">here</a>. Recurring donations through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=-Lm4ufIoIVeBypaM9HgKtQOGXhNDuJbgMacyGeP-zT8KFI9pmdsOKu2Q50CtJDt5DbYQN0&amp;country.x=US&amp;locale.x=US">Paypal</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OSTIF">Patreon</a> help us more than one-time commitments, as recurring funding allows us to better budget and plan our finances. Every little bit helps. The community effect adds up to help us cover all of our operations costs and tech expenses!</p>



<p>More importantly, you can help spread the word about our work. These projects only succeed because people hear about us and get involved. We have an active twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/ostifofficial?lang=en">@ostifofficial</a> and we are frequently on Reddit as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ostifofficial">/u/ostifofficial</a>. Tell people about our project and that we are making the Internet a safer place for all of us.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you work for a company that utilizes open-source software like OpenVPN, OpenSSL, Unbound, Open Office, BitMessage, VeraCrypt, MariaDB or VLC Media Player, PHP, Apache, DD-WRT, or GnuPG GPA, encourage them to get involved in the effort. We have various support tiers that companies can join to both help us make the internet more secure while simultaneously improving their own security. Companies that get involved also get a direct line to our managers to help us select future projects and direct the organization through our advisory counsel and steering committees.</p>



<p>We are excited to bring Unbound onto OSTIF support! Let&#8217;s get this done!</p>

<p>(This post will be updated regularly as we gain more sponsors and progress toward our total goal.)</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that we have raised 36% of the money needed to audit <a href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenSSL 1.1.1</span></a> with three weeks of fundraising completed. We expect to meet our goal by years-end if progress continues at this rate. We still have hundreds of companies to contact, talk to about our mission, and reach out to for support.</p>
<p>The community has been instrumental in this effort. Most of the people who want to support our goals reach out to us first. This is because friends and coworkers brought us to their employers attention, and got their company to make contact with us. If you work for a company that benefits greatly from OpenVPN, OpenSSL, GnuPG, OTR Chats, VeraCrypt FDE or containers, or any of our other supported projects, tell your friends and your coworkers. A small discussion can lead to big changes for OSTIF and the speed with which we can get things done.</p>
<p>The faster we complete fundraising and the more support we get, the faster we can move on to the next project and get more work done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/the-openssl-1-1-1-audit-fundraising-has-begun">The OpenSSL 1.1.1 Audit Fundraising has Begun!</a></h1>
<h2>What are we doing?</h2>
<p>Like our other fundraisers, OSTIF is reaching out to the public to fund a thorough and open audit of OpenSSL 1.1.1. This particular version is important because OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduces significant pieces of new code to implement the new TLS 1.3 standard.</p>
<p>Millions of websites (including 70% of the top million sites), apps, and individuals rely on OpenSSL 1.1.1 to keep user data safe and private. It is impossible to surf the web and not have OpenSSL protecting you during your travels.</p>
<p>A thorough and public review of the code will allow us to verify that OpenSSL is as safe as possible, and assure people around the world that this library is well coded and significantly hardened against flaws in both its software and its cryptography.</p>
<h2>What is the plan?</h2>
<p>This fundraiser will be ongoing until we meet our financial goal to get the project done. Then, we will schedule the audit and move forward. Once the audit is completed and the results are in, we will responsibly and securely disclose our findings to the OpenSSL security team, who will make any necessary updates to the software. After the patching is completed, our findings will be released to the public for transparent review.</p>
<h2>Who is conducting the audit?</h2>
<p>This audit is larger in scope than our previous two audits, both because of the size of the codebase and the enormous number of ways that the software is used. This audit will be a joint effort by QuarksLab and Kudelski Security. Two teams (two cryptographers and two software security experts) will review the code for a total of 1920 hours.</p>
<h2>What will the audit focus on?</h2>
<p>This is a wide security review that covers multiple areas of concern. OpenSSL has support from other groups and the core code is regularly fuzzed for typical programming errors. This means that our efforts will need to focus on areas that these techniques will frequently miss. We will be searching for more complex problems, verifying the cryptography, and looking at the areas that do not get the full attention of the current review process.</p>
<p>The areas of focus are:</p>
<p><strong>TLS 1.3</strong> &#8211; This is all green code that implements the new TLS 1.3 cryptographic standard. This is a large addition to the codebase and needs verification from outside experts that this new code is cryptographically sound, that the new software is free of serious problems, and that the TLS 1.3 code properly integrates with all other features.</p>
<p><strong>Crypto Engine based plugins</strong> &#8211; This is code that allows OpenSSL to work with other crypto engines such as Microsofts CryptoAPI. This code has not had a deep review and there&#8217;s potential for some issues with the interaction between the CryptoAPI and the OpenSSL Engine.</p>
<p><strong>The SRP Authentication Protocol</strong> &#8211; This code handles user/pass login systems and has not had a thorough review after its latest large update.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSSL&#8217;s updated PRNGs</strong> &#8211; The Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) is one of the most crucial components in digital security. The OpenSSL PRNGs have had significant updates and changes that need to be verified for safety. A problem with a PRNG can break an entire crypto system and has in the past ( <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-0166"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Debian Weak RNG</span></a> and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/01/14/hopefully-last-post-ill-ever-write-on/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">NSA Compromised Dual-EC-DRBG</span></a> )</p>
<p><strong>x86, x86-64, ARM, and ARM-64</strong> &#8211; We will investigate the differences between OpenSSL 1.1.1 for different hardware/OS architectures to look for unique problems that arise. x86 and x86-64 (aka x64) cover the vast majority of PC and server hardware. ARM and ARM-64 covers the vast majority of mobile device hardware as well as many low-power devices such as routers, consumer level firewalls, smart TV PCs, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Adding more hooks for libfuzzer and ossfuzzer</strong> &#8211; This will expand the area of the app that can be monitored by automated fuzzing, increasing the safety of OpenSSL through more thorough checking of memory safety and other common software errors that can lead to vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>How much do we need to raise?</h2>
<p>This project is more than four times as large as our <a href="https://ostif.org/the-openvpn-2-4-0-audit-by-ostif-and-quarkslab-results/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenVPN 2.4. project</span></a>, and the budget reflects that. We need to raise approximately $435,000 USD to pay the auditors, cover the overhead of the transactions, and leave a cushion in case of currency fluctuations in our cryptocurrency accounts or changes in international exchange rates. It also includes the costs of the fundraising activities themselves with advertising, designing and printing new shirts, and a travel budget if/when companies want to meet with us directly to talk about long-term support of the organization. As always, all remaining funds will go toward the bug bounty program to drive research that will further harden our supported applications.</p>
<h2>How can I contribute to this project?</h2>
<p>These projects only get done because the community comes together and contributes to the cause. The path to truly safe software starts here with public review and accountability in plain sight for everyone to see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Progress! Goals! Collaboration!</h1>
<p>We are reporting in with more progress updates on our<strong> fundraising</strong>, more specifics on our<strong> goals</strong>, and some positive news about<strong> collaboration</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fundraising:<br />
</strong>We have secured substantially more funding over the last few days, increasing our total cash raised to $41000. This places us at about 60% of our $71000 goal! We have had widespread support for the effort and now have a coalition of 21 companies and many individual donors from around the world.</p>
<p>We have completed our first round of contact with every VPN company in the world, and are now moving on to web hosting companies, internet security companies, and other businesses who are likely interested in a stronger OpenVPN.</p>
<p>The community has done a great job of getting the word out, and we need to keep it up! Be loud! If you&#8217;ve donated, give us a shoutout on Twitter ( @ostifofficial ) or tell your friends! Getting the word out is the greatest challenge we face, and you can help! If your VPN hasn&#8217;t donated yet, let them know that you want them to support the effort and get involved!</p>
<p><strong>Goals:<br />
</strong>We have finalized an agreement with QuarksLab on a price, duration, and depth of the audit. Our goal of $71000 is now cemented and we will be getting 45 man-days (about 650 man-hours) of auditing work done by a team of two senior researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration:<br />
</strong>As we had mentioned in our earlier postings, we were surprised to find out that a large VPN had decided to fund their own independent effort in full, and they had secured a top researcher to also evaluate the same version of OpenVPN that we were building this enormous effort to audit. We were concerned because the VPN company was not communicating with us, and we had heard through 3rd parties that they had no intention of collaborating with us. This worried us about our audit being seen as redundant or wasteful, even though experts in the field would agree that more review is always better.</p>
<p>We were hoping for a situation where the two audits could work together to make the greatest impact for OpenVPN, by auditing complementary areas of code or sharing results with one another to avoid redundancies and wasted effort by researchers.</p>
<p>We have be in contact with Dr. Green and we have had a positive conversation about collaboration. It looks like we will be able to turn these two separate audits into an even greater and more thorough review than either project would be able to do alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Fundraising Is Going Well, Progress Is Fast!</h1>
<p>We have had a lot of early success with our OpenVPN fundraiser, and the community response to the project has been tremendous with privacy advocates, VPN review sites, and VPN providers coming together to raise over $34,000 USD over the last two weeks. We think we are on track to meet our fundraising goals and get the audit process under way by January 1st 2017 as planned.</p>
<p>One of the common questions that we had on Reddit was about fundraising goals for how much we want to raise in order to meet our goals. Our response was vague because we were working on a large deal behind the scenes with a major IT company to secure some or even the majority of the funding through them alone. We were afraid of setting our goals too low and having the deal fall through, or setting the goal high and then lowering it when the deal went through. Either situation could be seen as misleading, and as a transparent organization we have attempted to stay as clear as possible to the public, while avoiding any possibilities for us to be seen in a bad light.</p>
<p>We regret to say that this deal with the major IT company has in fact fallen through. While this means that we have more fundraising to do, we can also be significantly more clear about how much money we need, who will be doing the audit, and how close we are to our goals.</p>
<p>The audit will be carried out by QuarksLab in Paris. Their exemplary job on a shoestring budget for the <a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/VeraCrypt-Audit-Final-for-Public-Release.pdf">VeraCrypt audit</a> has encouraged us to move forward with them on future projects. Fred, Jean-Baptiste, and Marion did fantastic work for us and we are looking forward to seeing what they can do on a full audit.</p>
<p>Our required budget for this project is estimated to be $71000 USD. This is due to the complexities of OpenVPN across many platforms, and the large number of dependencies. <strong>This places the current state of our fundraising at about 50% of our goal with just two weeks of fundraising under our belts!</strong> The support from the community has been strong and diverse, with donors from all over the world.</p>
<h1>Healthy Competition: A VPN Provider Has Decided To Do It Alone.</h1>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong></p>
<p>Two days ago, we learned about another effort to get OpenVPN 2.4 audited. We are thrilled to know that there are VPN companies that are willing to contribute significantly to the OpenVPN project. Unfortunately, this decision appears to have been made after OSTIF reached out to them for support multiple times, and the news came after two weeks of public fundraising had already been completed and a coalition of twenty VPN providers and dozens of other businesses had already been built.</p>
<p>They have made it clear that they have no intention to support the community effort, nor will their audit project collaborate with ours for the greater good.</p>
<p><strong>What OSTIF management thinks about this effort: </strong></p>
<p>We do not know the circumstances that led up to their decision. We have reached out to them directly and through multiple parties to collaborate on this effort. The only response we have received was through a 3rd party, and that they do not intend to collaborate. We are confused as to their intentions with this effort, but the evidence leads us to believe that this is an effort to derail the community audit, and possibly take all of the credit for themselves for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>There is also very little information about their effort, its scope, and who is doing the audit beyond one person.</p>
<p>This effort appears to have been significantly rushed, with the OpenVPN staff learning of this new effort three days prior to this writing. We had been collaborating with OpenVPN Technologies and the community on this effort for over six months, and carefully planning the fundraising and timing for the project.</p>
<p>We also took significant steps to try to select auditors who are not from nations in the Five-Eyes Intelligence Alliance because the OpenVPN 2.x has major contributions from Fox-IT, whose parent company is NCC Group, which has close ties with the government of the United Kingdom. We wanted to avoid any situation where it could be viewed by the world that a five-eyes company was auditing an app with significant contributions from groups that are tied to that same company.</p>
<p>We strive for impartiality and transparency at all steps of the process.</p>
<p><strong>What OSTIF intends to do moving forward:</strong></p>
<p>The position of OSTIF, after having meetings with our managers and our board of trustees, is that we are going to continue fundraising with the community, and we will execute the audit as planned. If the other audit group changes their minds, and wishes to collaborate on the project for the greater good of the community, we are open to it at any time.</p>
<p>We will complete a thorough and full audit on a tight timetable and continue with our goals to complete audits of our supported applications and move them on to the next stages of support. Our goals are to create stronger security and privacy tools for all, even when faced with resistance from moneyed interests.</p>
<p>These audits will only make OpenVPN <em><strong>safer</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Edit: Updates about the progress of this fundraiser are here: <a href="https://ostif.org/openvpn-audit-updates-news-and-more/">https://ostif.org/openvpn-audit-updates-news-and-more/</a></p>

<p>The details about the value of this effort and the power of OSTIF are below:</p>
<p><strong>Why OpenVPN?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/download/community-downloads.html">OpenVPN</a> is a cross platform and well supported Virtual Private Network application that is free to use for everyone around the world. It is available for all versions of Windows, OSX, Android, iOS, Chrome OS, most versions of Linux, and BSD. It is used worldwide by businesses to protect information that goes over insecure networks, and increasingly it is used by private users who want to protect their information from cybercrime and surveillance. OpenVPN is powerful, free, and used by millions of people. An audit of OpenVPN will add further integrity to the software, allowing users around the world to trust that the software is strong and resistant to intrusion.</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>OpenVPN version 2.4 has just entered beta, with a full release to soon follow. As the first major revision of the software to be released in years, it has a huge number of bug fixes and feature changes under the hood, giving an audit a great opportunity to review these new areas of code that will likely persist for years with small changes until OpenVPN 2.5 is ready to go. It is the most effective time for an audit to take place.</p>
<p><strong>Why OSTIF?</strong></p>
<p>We are an independent advocate for free and open software that improves the security of users around the world. We are efficient, open, and ready to tackle the problems that face free software. We have just completed our<a href="https://ostif.org/the-veracrypt-audit-results/"> audit of VeraCrypt 1.18</a> a few months ago, and we are striking while the iron is hot to continue making harder and more powerful security software for all of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beautiful.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elegant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stylish.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intelligent.</strong></p>
<p>These are the words that I, Derek Zimmer, and possibly someone else will describe you as when you are wearing our new OSTIF t-shirts!</p>
<p>The design is a black shirt with the white OSTIF.org logo on the front, and the back is a negative of <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35552.pdf">Snowden Document 20320108</a>. This is the document that showed that while the NSA is incredibly well resourced, they are not magic and cannot break the laws of physics and math. It showed definitively that properly implemented encryption really is unbreakable by having a Prism target using Off-the-Record fail to be decrypted.</p>
<p><a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ostif-shirt-sample-pics.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-639" src="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ostif-shirt-sample-pics.png" alt="ostif-shirt-sample-pics" width="800" height="191" srcset="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ostif-shirt-sample-pics.png 800w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ostif-shirt-sample-pics-300x72.png 300w, https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ostif-shirt-sample-pics-768x183.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>To qualify for a shirt, donate at least $50 through any method, and then send us an email with your shipping information and proof of payment. The shirts will be shipped in bulk at the end of the fundraiser (to save on printing costs). They are Gildan 100% cotton shirts and are available in men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s cuts. We will be showcasing a new design every fundraiser!</p>
<p>If you would like multiple shirts, let us know and we can negotiate something reasonable. Also, if you would like us to ship to you internationally, please add $10 to your donation (if it is the minimum $50).</p>
<p>The email to send your t-shirt information to is below:</p>
<p><a href="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/email-anti-ocr.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252" src="https://ostif.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/email-anti-ocr.png" alt="email anti ocr" width="300" height="100" /></a></p>
