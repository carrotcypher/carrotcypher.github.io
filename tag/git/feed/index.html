										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Results of Git Security Audit</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) is thrilled to announce the results of a security audit and threat model for <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>. Git is the world&#8217;s most widely used version control system, and it underpins not only open source, but the vast majority of public and private software development today. To say that git is infrastructure is an understatement, it reaches nearly every corner of software development and touches nearly every product that has software in one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, git is one of OSTIFs top priorities to help with security resources and has built a large coalition of companies to work on multiple facets of the git project. The security audit conducted by Markus Vervier and Eric Sesterhenn from <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/">X41</a> and Joern Schneeweisz from <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is only a part of the total efforts coordinated by OSTIF. <a href="https://github.com/">Github&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://codeql.github.com/">CodeQL team</a> (thank you Turbo!) is helping the git developers build a custom ruleset for CodeQL to help give the developers more meaningful results and cull false positives so that the tool is more usable than the previous static analysis tools (that the core git team had stopped using due to multiple difficulties). Additionally, Adolfo Veytia and John Speed Meyers from <a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/">Chainguard</a> along with Dennis Appelt from GitLab are working on how the Windows version of git is distributed to make recommendations and changes to improve the supply chain security of git. We will be releasing the results of those efforts as each of these projects is completed. This coalition of efforts is unified through our shared interests in git and the critical role that it plays in the open source world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is extremely grateful for the funding and support from the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/shared-success-in-building-a-safer-open-source-community/">Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST)</a> and the help of the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a> to help make this critical project more secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this portion of the research a total of 35 issues were discovered, including 2 critical severity findings and a high severity finding. Additionally, because of this research, a number of potentially catastrophic security bugs were discovered and resolved internally by the git security team. (A special thank you to Patrick Steinhardt for all of their work on the formatting issues related to CVE-2022-41903).<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The serious bug fixes are in the latest release of Git (released today).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The most notable issues were:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CRITICAL</strong> &#8211; CVE-2022-41903 &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-475x-2q3q-hvwq">Out-of-Bounds Memory Write in Log Formatting</a> (this had multiple collateral issues that were fixed by the git security team that were critical in nature)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CRITICAL</strong> &#8211; CVE-2022-23251 &#8211; Truncated Allocation Leading to Out of Bounds Write Via Large Number of Attributes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>HIGH</strong> &#8211; Out-of-Bounds Read Via Padding Placeholders</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The git team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by actively participating in the audit process and collaborating with the audit team during the initial meetings and security review. We&#8217;d like to thank everyone at git who helped us with this audit, with security tooling questions, and with understanding the git build process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results can be viewed in full detail at the following links:</span></p>

OSTIF is planning many security efforts in 2023, and funding audits like these can be a useful tool for securing projects in open source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to everyone from <a href="https://x41-dsec.de/">X41</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> that did excellent work on this audit!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on this type of security work being done, visit the OSTIF website. <a href="https://github.com/Amir-Montazery/OSTIF/blob/main/Completed-Engagements.md">We also have all of our published work on our Github</a>. Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Everyone around the world depends on open source software (OSS), and security audits play an important role in securing the open source ecosystem.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Announcement: </span></p>
<h1><b>Google is partnering with Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc to sponsor security reviews of critical open source software. </b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is elated to announce that we are planning to improve security of eight open-source projects thanks to support from the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/">Google Open Source Security Team</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This marks a major success in bringing on large corporate donors to support OSTIF’s model of improving open source software through security reviews and source code audits. A focused, well-scoped review by an experienced team can drive significant and long-lasting improvements in widely used projects. For example, </span><a href="https://ostif.org/our-audit-of-unbound-dns-by-x41-d-sec-full-results/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF’s end-to-end review of Unbound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an open-source Domain Name System (DNS) resolver used in securing websites, resulted in 48 changes that strengthened its security, including finding and patching one Critical, five High, and five Medium severity issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s support will allow OSTIF to launch the Managed Audit Program (MAP), which will expand our in-depth security reviews to even more projects vital to the open source ecosystem. Our initial list of </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oytKuD7UCX6nDXWQMr6ZgYYgap_SH_JVBof5gNrgSxo/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 MAP projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was identified empirically by research <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uahUIUa82J6WetAqtxCM_qgH-YJOagH84AFniIhlAbg">[ 1 ]</a>, <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf">[ 2 ]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00352.pdf">[ 3 ]</a> targeted at identifying the most critical digital infrastructure, and cross-referenced with </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenSSF’s Security Scorecards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prioritize projects within the list. Together, these efforts identified eight libraries, frameworks and apps that would benefit the most from security improvements and make the largest impact on the open-source ecosystem that relies on them. </span></p>
<h2><b>The Projects</b></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Git</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is the de facto version control software used in modern DevOps. According to the </span><a href="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/ossf-criticality-score/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Git is the second-most critical application in C and the 10th-most critical application across all platforms. In development since 2005, git makes up the foundation of </span><a href="https://github.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">github</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gitlab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is undoubtedly one of the most critical pieces of open-source software in the world. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lodash</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>, a modern JavaScript utility library with over 200 functions to facilitate web development, can be found in most environments that support JavaScript, which is most of the world wide web. Lodash is also used and tested in most current web browsers, including Chrome since v74. Lodash was chosen for security review due to ubiquity and project age, along with a relatively high </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 77%. The Linux Foundation &amp; The Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard’s study titled </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identified lodash as one of the most used packages according to dependency analysis. Furthermore, taking into account at least </span><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=20100&amp;product_id=57083&amp;version_id=0&amp;page=1&amp;hasexp=0&amp;opdos=0&amp;opec=0&amp;opov=0&amp;opcsrf=0&amp;opgpriv=0&amp;opsqli=0&amp;opxss=0&amp;opdirt=0&amp;opmemc=0&amp;ophttprs=0&amp;opbyp=0&amp;opfileinc=0&amp;opginf=0&amp;cvssscoremin=0&amp;cvssscoremax=0&amp;year=0&amp;cweid=0&amp;order=1&amp;trc=4&amp;sha=ec99d3827329b3d01f3412ca337b0d88dfbde6dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 reported vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 2018 and a </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 50%, it is reasonable to justify a Security Review and a boost to security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laravel</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> is a php web application framework that is used by many modern, full-stack web applications, including integrations with Google Cloud. Laravel was chosen for security review due to ubiquity and project age along with a relatively high </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticality Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 79%. Laravel has at least 9 reported vulnerabilities since 2017 and a </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 58%, making it a good candidate for Security Review and a boost to security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slf4j</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">Slf4j</a> is a logging facade for various Java logging frameworks. </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identified slf4j as one of most-used non-JavaScript packages according to dependency analysis. Factoring in the project age of 16 years and various vulnerability reports, such as </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8088"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CVE-2018-0088</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a detailed review would likely provide substantial improvement to its security posture. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson-core &amp; Jackson-databind</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core">Jackson-core</a> is a JSON for Java, Streaming API, and extra shared components and the base the </span><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson data-bind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> package. Both projects were identified by </span><a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/census_ii_vulnerabilities_in_the_core.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerabilities in the Core”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the 1st and 2nd most-used non-JavaScript packages. With project ages of over 9 years and </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 42% and 58% respectively, it is reasonable to justify a review and a boost to security posture for these widely-used dependencies.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Httpcomponents-core &amp; Httpcomponents-client</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core and client components of <a href="https://hc.apache.org/">Apache httpcomponents</a>, these projects are responsible for creating and maintaining a toolset of low-level Java components focused on HTTP and associated protocols. Fundamental functions of the web, these projects were identified in the most widely used non-javascript packages. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Thank You</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to thank the Google Open Source Security Team for helping us scale our impact to not only find bugs but also fix issues across the open-source ecosystem. From here, we hope to significantly grow operations to support hundreds of projects in the coming few years. To reach this goal, we will need support from the communities that rely on this infrastructure, and improve our data to target the best projects for our work. In the end, we believe these combined efforts will lead to a safer open source environment for everyone.</span></p>
