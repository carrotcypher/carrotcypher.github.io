<p>We are currently hosting a KickStarter project to help pay for a direct to garment printer that we can use to raise funds for all of our future fundraisers. This will allow us to give attractive gifts to our backers while raising money to enable the crucial security work that we do.</p>
<p>We have worked on this for months, making sure that we are compliant with the state of IL by getting resellers license and a tax ID, tons of business research on the real world costs of t-shirt printing as a business, probing shipping partnerships, and working with over a dozen artists to make our 40+ designs! We are also making custom engraved RFID-blocking wallets which we can laser engrave with a design of your choosing!</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to take a look at our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ostif/ostif-building-a-better-internet-with-shirts">awesome gallery of stuff we have put together on KickStarter</a>!</p>
