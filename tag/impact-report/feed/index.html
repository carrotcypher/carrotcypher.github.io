<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We at OSTIF are so grateful to add value to partners like CNCF. I am proud of the fact that we can be approached with a project, collaborate with its community, and organize a security audit that helps improve security posture- all in a way that is effective, transparent, and cost effective. CNCF provides a strong support system to help its projects improve and grow, and funding security audits is just one example.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today OSTIF is thrilled to release the Independent Security Audit Impact Report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This report is the culmination of over a year’s worth of work that OSTIF organized thanks to funding from Google and OpenSSF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am extremely proud of this work and what OSTIF continues to accomplish. Organizations like Google, OpenSSF, and many others are eager to fund initiatives that help secure the open source ecosystem, and I firmly believe that OSTIF is one of the best outlets for doing just that. We were able to take almost $1,000,000 and turn it into significant security improvements to critical projects in one year.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>The Cloud Native Computing Foundation and OSTIF Impact Report</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF has been working with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) on a number of security projects over the last year. This has been a large collaborative effort to help CNCF projects improve their security posture by conducting code audits, building security tools, directing supply chain reviews, building fixes, and assisting projects with unique challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This report showcases the impact of our works on seven different projects (Argo, Backstage, Containerd, CRI-O, Envoy, Flux, KubeEdge). We also have eight projects with the CNCF in progress or scheduled for the remainder of 2022 that are not included in the scope of this report. Additionally, the project with Envoy is ongoing and is expected to continue to garner significant additional security progress.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Material Progress</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This partnership arose from the need for the CNCF to find a security partner that can readily work with open source projects to support their development in an impactful way. OSTIF&#8217;s tireless work in this area to build partnerships with security firms that understand open source, and our systems that deliver strong results while maintaining full transparency was a perfect match. In this report we show that we meet every challenge and bring real tangible improvements to the open source ecosystem.</span></p>
