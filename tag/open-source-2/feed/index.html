Equinox P2 is a provisioning platform, started by IBM in 2001. The Eclipse Foundation was founded three years later to act as an open, non-for-profit leader of the Eclipse Project community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF was contacted by the Foundation, with </span><a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2022/06/20/openssf-funds-python-and-eclipse-foundations-and-acquires-sos-dev-through-alpha-omega-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400">funding from OpenSSF project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, to perform a security audit and provide recommendations for security hardening. With Include Security, the audit resulted in a developed threat model, code review, and analysis of SAST and fuzzing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Include Security team followed a static code analysis with white-box code review methodology throughout the engagement. The result was one critical, three medium, and five low-risk findings. For the threat model, the focal point was on feasibly applicable threat actors to PGP-based signature verification. Everything else was considered out of the scope of the audit. In a methodical practice, Include created a threat model of the Target of Evaluation after a four step system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the 22 person days spent on the audit, Include Security also worked on SAST tooling and fuzzing for continuous monitoring. In the report, Include Security offers three security tools and recommendations of how fuzzing and SAST tooling could be reworked to best run on P2’s code. This would be mainly by adding rules to scanners to eliminate noise and false positives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSTIF would like to extend our gratitude to the Equinox P2 team and the Eclipse Foundation for their participation and partnership in this security audit, particularly Mikael Barbero and Marta Rybczynska. Thank you as well to those at Include Security, for their hard work and final report on this project. Finally, we would like to acknowledge and thank OpenSSF </span><a href="https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Project Alpha-Omega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for their financial support of this critical security work. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We have just completed our review of <a href="https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/">OpenSSL 1.1.1 with QuarksLab</a>, and we are moving on to our next big project, Unbound DNS!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />What is Unbound and Why is it Important?</h2>



<p>One of the core functions of the internet is domain name resolution. This means that when you type in a domain name like &#8220;ostif.org&#8221; into your browser, your computer asks a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name Server</a> (DNS Server) where OSTIF.org is, and that server returns an address to your browser so that it knows where to go to load the site. This same system is used in apps, operating systems, and every web-connected service.</p>



<p>The entire DNS system is decades old and was not originally designed with security or privacy in mind. This means that DNS was designed as &#8220;connectionless&#8221; and without encryption. This opens up DNS to all kinds of problem like <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/dns-reflection-attack/">DNS reflection attacks</a> (hijacking many DNS servers to knock down websites via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing">DNS Spoofing and DNS Poisoning</a> (an attacker intercepting your DNS requests and sending back malicious IP addresses), and wholesale surveillance (all DNS requests going through multiple parties on the web who can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_analytics">record every website you visit and every service you use</a>).</p>



<p>To fix this, standards have been developed to make DNS more trustworthy by encrypting the connections and verifying the data coming back from the servers is not from an interloper. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DNS over TLS</a> are the two major solutions used today.</p>



<p>The most popular open-source solution out there is <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> by <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/">NLNetLabs</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To help increase online privacy, Unbound supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858">DNS-over-TLS</a> which allows clients to encrypt their communication. In addition, it supports various modern standards that limit the amount of data exchanged with authoritative servers. These standards do not only improve privacy but also help making the DNS more robust. The most important are <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7816">Query Name Minimisation</a>, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8198">Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache</a> and support for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7706">authority zones</a>, which can be used to load a copy of the root zone.</p>
<cite>https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about</cite></blockquote>



<p>Not only is it widely used in many sites and services, but it is integrated into projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> that are increasing the security of the entire Internet through enabling widespread use of free security certificates for Domain Names. Let&#8217;s Encrypt serves over 150 million domain certificates that enable https on websites around the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Are We Collaborating?</h2>



<p>OSTIF and Unbound have been discussing their current security practices and potential improvements, as well as establishing secure communications with NLNetLabs for reporting issues. Now, we are raising money for a full security review of Unbound, which will be conducted with <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41-Dsec in Germany</a>. After all issues are resolved we will publish the audit report for the public to review, and then Unbound will join our bug-bounty program to bring white-hat hackers around the world in to do continuous review of the code and locate further issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much do we need to raise?</h2>



<p>We need to raise approximately <strong>$139,000</strong> in total to cover the cost of the audit, the pool of money for the bug bounty system, and various operations costs (transaction fees on donations, etc). These numbers come from the size of the code base, the complexity of the code, the quality of the documentation on how the app works, and the current security practices which influence the scope of the audit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW TO GET INVOLVED!</h2>



<p>You can donate to us through a huge number of easy options <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/">here</a>. Recurring donations through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=-Lm4ufIoIVeBypaM9HgKtQOGXhNDuJbgMacyGeP-zT8KFI9pmdsOKu2Q50CtJDt5DbYQN0&amp;country.x=US&amp;locale.x=US">Paypal</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OSTIF">Patreon</a> help us more than one-time commitments, as recurring funding allows us to better budget and plan our finances. Every little bit helps. The community effect adds up to help us cover all of our operations costs and tech expenses!</p>



<p>More importantly, you can help spread the word about our work. These projects only succeed because people hear about us and get involved. We have an active twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/ostifofficial?lang=en">@ostifofficial</a> and we are frequently on Reddit as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ostifofficial">/u/ostifofficial</a>. Tell people about our project and that we are making the Internet a safer place for all of us.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you work for a company that utilizes open-source software like OpenVPN, OpenSSL, Unbound, Open Office, BitMessage, VeraCrypt, MariaDB or VLC Media Player, PHP, Apache, DD-WRT, or GnuPG GPA, encourage them to get involved in the effort. We have various support tiers that companies can join to both help us make the internet more secure while simultaneously improving their own security. Companies that get involved also get a direct line to our managers to help us select future projects and direct the organization through our advisory counsel and steering committees.</p>



<p>We are excited to bring Unbound onto OSTIF support! Let&#8217;s get this done!</p>
