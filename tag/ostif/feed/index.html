										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSTIF is pleased to announce that another audit has reached publication! A security audit of simplejson’s source code was conducted in collaboration with X41. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found during the audit process were one medium and two low severity issues, as well as nine more informational issues. In addition, custom differential fuzzing harnesses were made to compare C and Python implementations of simplejson with differential fuzzing across simplejson and orjson to ascertain parsing discrepancies in the two libraries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">X41’s work in the Python encoder/decoder supported previous security research in simplejson. A mature project like simpejson has many maintainers and contributors over its long life, yet there were still minor fissures in the code that were addressed and patched. The efforts provided by a skilled third-party reviewer can help mature projects further their security concerns and goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thank X41 for their continued work with OSTIF in helping open source projects navigate the complex security space. Also, thank you to Amazon Web Services for sponsoring this critically important work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to </span><a href="https://github.com/etrepum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Ippolito</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of simplejson, whose collaboration and openness to working with us made the effort all the more impactful. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many open source projects such as simplejson are developed by volunteers without funding, sponsorship, or dedicated security resources, yet they have become embedded in infrastructure where security is critical. The OSTIF funded security audit of simplejson performed by X41 D-Sec was thorough; it identified potential security issues (minor, in this case) and included several specific recommendations for security hardening that will help the project remain safe to use. Even as a solo maintainer, it was a breeze to work with OSTIF and X41 D-Sec. The entire engagement from their initial email to the release of simplejson v3.9.1 took less than a month, just a few emails and one meeting on my end before receiving the initial report. I&#8217;d highly recommend working with OSTIF to other open source maintainers, and if I was still a decision maker at a corporation I&#8217;d devote resources to sponsoring this important work!” </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Bob Ippolito, simplejson </span></i></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Amazon Web Services Supports Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amir Montazery, Managing Director, Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc (OSTIF)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OSTIF team is absolutely thrilled to announce that we’ve reached an agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide $500,000 in funding. The funding from AWS will help OSTIF scale our ability to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical open source projects. In particular, the goal is to improve the sustainability of upstream projects commonly used in the open source ecosystem.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2022 proved to be an impactful year for OSTIF, as we executed over 20 security engagements for critical open source projects; resulting in over 35 Critical/High Vulnerability patches and upwards of 165 total security improvements. Approximately 50 automated security tools, such as fuzzers and CI implementations, were developed to continuously monitor these projects, providing long-term benefits to security posture. The support from AWS will allow us to continue to do that into 2023 and scale our ability to help critical open source projects that everyone depends on.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Amir Montazery, Managing Director, OSTIF</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Creating healthy and sustainable open source communities is the guiding principle behind our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source investments. By sponsoring OSTIF and OpenSSF, we are helping to ensure the long-term security and viability of critical open source software projects that will benefit our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customers, AWS, and the entire information technology ecosystem..&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (<a href="https://ostif.org">ostif.org</a>) is thrilled to report the results of a security audit of <a href="https://kubeedge.io">KubeEdge</a>. KubeEdge is an edge computing framework built on top of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> and extends native containerized application orchestration and management to hosts at the edge.</p>
<p>The result of this engagement is the finding and fixing of multiple medium severity issues, threat modeling, and integration to <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz">OSS Fuzz</a>. 10 fuzzers in total were written, and these fuzzers were set up to run in the CI for pull requests. Several issues were found by the fuzzers, including 2 of the 8 CVEs.</p>
<p>The KubeEdge team demonstrated a strong commitment to security and was fast to reproduce crashes and respond with patches. This type of engagement and collaboration from project maintainers helps the security audit process be more effective and impactful. We thank Kevin Wang, Fisher Xu, Vincent Lin and everyone who helped with this engagement.</p>
<p>Thank you to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF) for funding this audit and entrusting Open Source Technology Improvement Fund to facilitate it. Special thanks to David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of <a href="https://adalogics.com/">Ada Logics</a> for conducting the audit.</p>
<p>Everyone around the world depends on OSS. We’d love to do more security audits to proactively find and fix vulnerabilities! If you’re interested in financially supporting this work, contact amir@ostif.org.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OSTIF has been working with the <a href="https://openssf.org/">Open Source Security Foundation&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-critical-projects">Securing Critical Projects working group</a> to help identify critical pieces of infrastructure that require focused security attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony">Symfony</a>, a widely used PHP framework has consistently been near the top of multiple reports, underscoring the criticality of the project to the open source community. It also appears on the OSTIF <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oytKuD7UCX6nDXWQMr6ZgYYgap_SH_JVBof5gNrgSxo">Managed Audit Program 25</a>, a doc that pulls data from multiple sources to develop a high priority list of projects to consider for security review and free consulting.</p>
<p>When the opportunity for a grant arose, OSTIF hand picked Symfony as the project of choice for the proposed budget. Symfony represents a cross-section of criticality, complexity, and visible security practices that make the project an ideal candidate for benefiting from our free auditing services. The OpenSSF technical advisory committee, the governing board, and the budget committee all approved the project, which gives OSTIF another exciting opportunity to showcase the value of our work to the world.</p>
<p>As this project progresses, we will work with our security teams to create the most effective scope for the budget that we have, work with the project maintainers to set up clear communication and to share their any concerns that they have about components or areas of code that they might find problematic, and guide them through the audit process and resolution.</p>
<p>When the project completes, we will post the results here, and on multiple services that aggregate audit information for easy access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We have just completed our review of <a href="https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/">OpenSSL 1.1.1 with QuarksLab</a>, and we are moving on to our next big project, Unbound DNS!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br />What is Unbound and Why is it Important?</h2>



<p>One of the core functions of the internet is domain name resolution. This means that when you type in a domain name like &#8220;ostif.org&#8221; into your browser, your computer asks a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name Server</a> (DNS Server) where OSTIF.org is, and that server returns an address to your browser so that it knows where to go to load the site. This same system is used in apps, operating systems, and every web-connected service.</p>



<p>The entire DNS system is decades old and was not originally designed with security or privacy in mind. This means that DNS was designed as &#8220;connectionless&#8221; and without encryption. This opens up DNS to all kinds of problem like <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/dns-reflection-attack/">DNS reflection attacks</a> (hijacking many DNS servers to knock down websites via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing">DNS Spoofing and DNS Poisoning</a> (an attacker intercepting your DNS requests and sending back malicious IP addresses), and wholesale surveillance (all DNS requests going through multiple parties on the web who can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_analytics">record every website you visit and every service you use</a>).</p>



<p>To fix this, standards have been developed to make DNS more trustworthy by encrypting the connections and verifying the data coming back from the servers is not from an interloper. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DNS over TLS</a> are the two major solutions used today.</p>



<p>The most popular open-source solution out there is <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> by <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/">NLNetLabs</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To help increase online privacy, Unbound supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858">DNS-over-TLS</a> which allows clients to encrypt their communication. In addition, it supports various modern standards that limit the amount of data exchanged with authoritative servers. These standards do not only improve privacy but also help making the DNS more robust. The most important are <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7816">Query Name Minimisation</a>, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8198">Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache</a> and support for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7706">authority zones</a>, which can be used to load a copy of the root zone.</p>
<cite>https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about</cite></blockquote>



<p>Not only is it widely used in many sites and services, but it is integrated into projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> that are increasing the security of the entire Internet through enabling widespread use of free security certificates for Domain Names. Let&#8217;s Encrypt serves over 150 million domain certificates that enable https on websites around the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Are We Collaborating?</h2>



<p>OSTIF and Unbound have been discussing their current security practices and potential improvements, as well as establishing secure communications with NLNetLabs for reporting issues. Now, we are raising money for a full security review of Unbound, which will be conducted with <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41-Dsec in Germany</a>. After all issues are resolved we will publish the audit report for the public to review, and then Unbound will join our bug-bounty program to bring white-hat hackers around the world in to do continuous review of the code and locate further issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much do we need to raise?</h2>



<p>We need to raise approximately <strong>$139,000</strong> in total to cover the cost of the audit, the pool of money for the bug bounty system, and various operations costs (transaction fees on donations, etc). These numbers come from the size of the code base, the complexity of the code, the quality of the documentation on how the app works, and the current security practices which influence the scope of the audit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW TO GET INVOLVED!</h2>



<p>You can donate to us through a huge number of easy options <a href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/">here</a>. Recurring donations through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=-Lm4ufIoIVeBypaM9HgKtQOGXhNDuJbgMacyGeP-zT8KFI9pmdsOKu2Q50CtJDt5DbYQN0&amp;country.x=US&amp;locale.x=US">Paypal</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/OSTIF">Patreon</a> help us more than one-time commitments, as recurring funding allows us to better budget and plan our finances. Every little bit helps. The community effect adds up to help us cover all of our operations costs and tech expenses!</p>



<p>More importantly, you can help spread the word about our work. These projects only succeed because people hear about us and get involved. We have an active twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/ostifofficial?lang=en">@ostifofficial</a> and we are frequently on Reddit as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ostifofficial">/u/ostifofficial</a>. Tell people about our project and that we are making the Internet a safer place for all of us.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you work for a company that utilizes open-source software like OpenVPN, OpenSSL, Unbound, Open Office, BitMessage, VeraCrypt, MariaDB or VLC Media Player, PHP, Apache, DD-WRT, or GnuPG GPA, encourage them to get involved in the effort. We have various support tiers that companies can join to both help us make the internet more secure while simultaneously improving their own security. Companies that get involved also get a direct line to our managers to help us select future projects and direct the organization through our advisory counsel and steering committees.</p>



<p>We are excited to bring Unbound onto OSTIF support! Let&#8217;s get this done!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We would like to thank our sponsors <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a></span> and <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></span> for helping to fund this security review, as well as all of our  donors and individual supporters. This crucial work doesn’t happen without support from the community.</p>
<h2>The quick and dirty:</h2>
<p>OpenSSL version 1.1.1 was evaluated with special foci on new TLS 1.3 features and changes made to the Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). The PRNG review was conducted by Dr JP Aumasson and Antony Vennard with a follow-up review by the QuarksLab team. The general review was for all new code in OpenSSL 1.1.1 with a focus on TLS 1.3 and the changed PRNG.</p>
<p>QuarksLab found a number of small issues, all of which were resolved before the public release of OpenSSL version 1.1.1. Issues one and two would have led to <em>client-side denial-of-service vulnerabilities</em>, where a malicious man-in-the-middle could cause OpenSSL to crash by sending invalid information.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1:</strong> In some situations a connection could fail without an alert being sent. <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6852">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6852</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Issue 2:</strong> Multiple issues with TLS v1.3 alerts. <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6887">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6887</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Issue 3: New PRNG</strong> – The new pseudorandom number generator in OpenSSL does follow the NIST standard implementation SP800-90A, but the code quality could improve, with better comments and more clearly defined functions. (Note: The version of the code reviewed was after the improvements made that were <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://ostif.org/our-review-of-the-openssl-1-1-1-random-number-generation-update/">recommended by our other team, led by JP Aumasson</a></span>.)</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4: SRP Authentication Protocol</strong> – The SRP auth protocol is correctly implemented, but the code quality could improve, with better comments and more clearly defined functions. Also, SRP lacked some return value checks that would ensure that values are in an expected state. This was improved with <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8019"><span style="color: #289dcc;">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8019</span></a> The specific commit is here: <a href="https://github.com/liqifyl/openssl-image/commit/495a1e5c3aec4d44558cd86161b8385f1b1b6822"><span style="color: #289dcc;">https://github.com/liqifyl/openssl-image/commit/495a1e5c3aec4d44558cd86161b8385f1b1b6822</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Issue 5: CAPI</strong> – The code lacks comments, making the implementation hard to follow and understand. Other than these best practices issues, the code is well written and no problems were found.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 6: Global Lack of NULL Checks</strong> – The QuarksLab team recommended that null checks be present in many of the internal functions of OpenSSL, as a null value being passed where it is not expected by the software leads to unpredictable behavior that can lead to security or stability problems.</p>
<p>The OpenSSL development team intentionally omits null checks for performance reasons, and further notes that there no known ways to pass null values in OpenSSL <em>that lead to vulnerabilities</em>.</p>
<p>OSTIF consulted two other security experts regarding this issue, and both agreed that while null checks can be a best practice for a defense-in-depth code strategy, it is unlikely that a vulnerability from a lack of null checks will surface unless it is portions of the code that can be called remotely.</p>
<p>This is a small best practices issue that does not cause any known vulnerability or problem, and the expert opinions on the real impact differ, and the OpenSSL team did not patch.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>OpenSSL has successfully transitioned to TLS 1.3 without any serious security problems that we’ve found. The code quality and comments could stand to be improved in areas, but the code is functional, secure, and fast. The OpenSSL security team was fantastic throughout the entire process, assisting us with questions and quickly responding to concerns that were raised as we found them.</p>
<p>Our work on OpenSSL has led to a total of 16 recommendations and changes in OpenSSL, and we will be adding OpenSSL to our bug bounty program for version 1.1.1a and later through our partnership with the <a href="https://internetbugbounty.org/"><span style="color: #289dcc;">Internet Bug Bounty</span></a> on <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/"><span style="color: #289dcc;">HackerOne</span></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>OSTIF is Partnering with the Internet Bug Bounty and HackerOne for Bug Bounties!</h1>
<p>The <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ostif.org">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a></span> will be partnering with the <a href="https://internetbugbounty.org/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Internet Bug Bounty</span></a> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a></span> in a partnership that will get our supported projects listed on HackerOne with no overhead costs!</p>
<p><strong>HackerOne</strong> is the de-facto site for bug hunters around the world, with a community of thousands of skilled researchers at their disposal. This partnership brings an army of application security engineers and cryptographers to review our projects and submit bugs and receive bounties in an organized and effective way.</p>
<p>Our initial supported projects will be the <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">VeraCrypt project</span></a>, the <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenVPN project</span></a>, and the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL project</a></span> will be added after the results of our OpenSSL 1.1.1 audit are publicly available.</p>
<p>The bounties will initially match our own bug-bounty program, with up to $2500 for locating a bug (based on severity) and up to a $2500 bonus for submitting a fix to the project that prevents the problem from resurfacing through regression or new code introduced to the project. The fixes can include providing the tools to locate the bug (must be FOSS), providing a security patch, or improving security practices at the project. The fix must be accepted and integrated into the project to qualify. If a fix is provided and it is of low code quality, does not provide documentation or introduces other problems, the bonus may not qualify.</p>
<p>We are excited with this new partnership and it represents months of back-and-forth negotiations to get the terms of this deal to be ironed out.</p>
<p>I want to extend a special thank you to our primary sponsors that provided the bulk of the funding for this project that allowed it to happen. Thank you to <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Private Internet Access</span></a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Duck Duck Go</span></a>, <a href="https://openvpn.net/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenVPN Technologies</span></a>, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.ipredator.se/">iPredator</a></span> and <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ExpressVPN</span></a> for sponsoring our critical work to make the internet safer for all of us!</p>

Bulletproofs are a trustless proofs setup that are substantially smaller than the current Borromean style range proofs that were previously used, which reduces the size of Monero transactions by 80-90%.</p>
<p>Monero’s latest network update, which is now live, has enabled Bulletproofs and corrected all outstanding issues that were raised by the Kudelski and QuarksLab projects.</p>
<p><strong>QuarksLab found:</strong><br />
8 <span style="color: #cc284b;">Critical</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
2 <span style="color: #cca928;">Medium</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
20 <span style="color: #28cc57;">Low</span> or <span style="color: #28cc57;">Informational</span> Vulnerabilities / Concerns / Recommendations</p>
<hr />
<h4><span style="color: #cc284b;">One live-chain critical flaw identified and fixed:</span></h4>
<p>QuarksLab found a denial of service vulnerability that could allow an attacker to <strong>arbitrarily crash Monero nodes remotely</strong>, creating a vulnerability for a large-scale denial of service campaign for the Monero network and further potentially leading to a 51% attack and forced chain split, ultimately leading to double-spends.</p>
<p>Because this flaw impacted live code, OSTIF, QuarksLab, and the Monero team agreed to a disclosure embargo on this report until after the latest network upgrade that forced users to upgrade their nodes to patched code. The Monero XMR network is now safe from this flaw.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other serious bugs that were identified and fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>A lack of null value checks in the Bulletproofs proving algorithm.</em></span> The bulletproofs code relies on values being passed to it not being null, but did not proactively ensure that null values cannot be passed or checked for.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Dependent Generators in original java version of Bulletproofs are not secure.</em></span> The code had to be revised to improve number generation.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Overflow in double scalar multiplication.</em></span> The code needed to be patched to prevent the overflow of data.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Erroneous identity output in Bos-Coster multi-exponentiation.</em></span> The structure of the code could select the wrong input and return incorrect values.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Silently discarded element in Pippenger multi-exponentiation.</em></span> An optimization designed to discard large numbers of leading zeros could return the identity if a value of x^0 was entered into the function, meaning that the operation can return the identity unmodified. The optimization also had the additional issue of possibly discarding critical values for exact powers of two as inputs.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Invalid Verify input parameters.</em></span> There are no checks that the points provided are indeed points of Ed25519 and that they are on the main subgroup.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Key compromise in Schnorr signature.</em></span> In order to generate a valid Schnorr signature, the value k cannot be null or zero. If the value is null, an attacker can detect this and know the value of the key used to sign. If the value k is zero, then the value of the result is independent of the key and invalid. Checks needed to be added to the Schnorr signature to verify that the value k is not null or zero.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Failures in input size validation during (de)serialization.</em></span> A serialization error could allow an attacker to allocate up to 4GB of memory by initializing a value of 0 for nbp. Consequently, this can lead to memory being allocated for partially completed containers.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Failures in input type validation during (de)serialization.</em></span> A lack of robust checking for input type error from untrusted sources can lead to undesired behavior and error states.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Twenty other recommendations to improve security, robustness, practices, and performance.</em></span> The team also made a number of recommendations to code practices to improve the robustness of Monero code, to optimize performance, to improve error handling, and to reduce the attack surface of the software.</li>
</ul>

Bulletproofs is a trustless proofs setup that is substantially smaller than the current Borromean style range proofs that are currently used, promising to make Monero transactions 10-20% of their current size.</p>
<p>Kudelski found that the code was largely clean and that the C implementation that Monero has developed from the original Java code is suitable for use. Their findings did include 4 low severity bugs that have been patched, as well as a number of informational issues.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The bugs that were fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-001: Unsafe use of environment variables</span><br />
Patch: This function no longer uses environment variables to set this value, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in commit 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-002: Lack of input validation in prover</span><br />
Patch: Input scalars are now checked to ensure they are within the proper range in the prove and verify routines, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-F-003: Integer overflow in bulletproof L size computation</span><br />
Patch: Correct boundary checks have been added to avoid the overflow, as <span style="color: #28cc57;">patched in commit 68f7606</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;">BP-O-008: Undefined behavior shifting signed value</span><br />
Patch: The function has been rewritten using a ternary operator in <span style="color: #28cc57;">commit 68f7606</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with updates to the bulletproofs code which fixes all of the high priority concerns.</p>
<p>This is the first of two audits that are sponsored by <a href="https://lab.getmonero.org/">Monero Research Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/">The Monero Community</a>, <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>, and <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a>.
