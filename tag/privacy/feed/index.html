<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duckduckgo</a>, the privacy search engine, has contributed to OSTIF for a second time by donating $25,000 USD. Their site that tracks their charitable donations <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/2021-duckduckgo-donations/">Spread Privacy</a> has the official announcement.</p>
<p>These funds are not allocated to any specific project, which helps OSTIF tremendously by allowing us to spend resources on overhead costs of doing business that the organization needs to spend money on to function. Most of our funding from corporate donors comes with specific projects in mind and doesn&#8217;t significantly help the core organization function.</p>
<p>Duckduckgo originally donated to OSTIF for <a href="https://ostif.org/the-veracrypt-audit-results/">our first project, VeraCrypt</a>, which helped prove that our concept worked and ultimately led to where we are today, nearly six years later. Their continued support shows their commitment to keeping the open source projects we rely on secure.</p>
<p>And a special thank you to Katie and Charlie for helping to make this happen!</p>

<p>It has been a while since we have done a round of updates on what we are working on.</p>



<p>We have a number of projects that are currently active and more starting up. Throughout 2019 we expect to finish more than twice as many total projects and to continue with our current commitments to transparency and public review.</p>



<p>In the immediate future, you should see an update to our public books for 2018, which will show where every dollar that we took in was spent. We will also release a separate financial report that shows our goals and how we fared with our actual financial management for the year. (We are expecting the results to look good!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here is a list of our current projects and their status:</h2>



<p><strong>VeraCrypt</strong> &#8211; Maintenance &#8211; We have audited the software and it is currently active on our bug bounty program on HackerOne through our partnership with the Internet Bug Bounty.</p>



<p><strong>OpenVPN</strong> &#8211; Maintenance &#8211; We have audited version 2.4.0 and are preparing a second round of audits for version 2.5.0. It is currently active on our bug bounty program on HackerOne through our partnership with the Internet Bug Bounty.</p>



<p><strong>Monero Bulletproofs</strong> &#8211; Completed &#8211; We conducted audits with two different teams, funded by the Monero community and Monero Research Lab. This was a one-off relationship with Monero, but we plan to work with them in the future as need arises.</p>



<p><strong>OpenSSL</strong> &#8211; Auditing &#8211; We are in the process of auditing version 1.1.1 and results should be forthcoming in a few days. The final version of the document is being drafted now. After the audit is published, we will be funding a bug bounty through the Internet Bug Bounty on HackerOne.</p>



<p><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> &#8211; Bidding Started &#8211; We are taking bids on auditing VLC, and establishing what the VLC team needs to help improve the project.</p>



<p><strong>DD-WRT</strong> &#8211; Bidding Started &#8211; We are taking bids on auditing specific builds of DD-WRT. We are reaching out to the project to learn about the needs of the development team and their current security practices.</p>



<p><strong>Grin</strong> &#8211; Starting &#8211; We are in talks with Grin about assisting the project with audits of their infrastructure and code. This project will be self-funded by the Grin community.</p>



<p><strong>MariaDB</strong> &#8211; Starting &#8211; We will be approaching MariaDB to discuss the needs of the project shortly. An audit is likely.</p>



<p><strong>GnuPG&#8217;s Gnu Privacy Guard</strong> &#8211; Starting &#8211; We will be approaching the project to discuss the needs of the project shortly. An audit is likely.</p>



<p><strong>BitMessage</strong> &#8211; Starting &#8211; We are in the process of negotiating with the maintainer an audit and infrastructure review.</p>



<p><strong>Reproducible Builds</strong> &#8211; Open Talks &#8211; We are attempting to help the reproducible builds project find funding, as the technology is crucial to making software more reliable and trustworthy.</p>



<p><strong>PHP</strong> &#8211; Coming Soon</p>



<p><strong>Apache HTTP Server</strong> &#8211; Coming Soon</p>



<p><strong>WordPress.org</strong> &#8211; Coming Soon</p>



<p>We are expecting 2019 to be our busiest year yet! Check back with us frequently for progress!</p>

Bulletproofs are a trustless proofs setup that are substantially smaller than the current Borromean style range proofs that were previously used, which reduces the size of Monero transactions by 80-90%.</p>
<p>Monero’s latest network update, which is now live, has enabled Bulletproofs and corrected all outstanding issues that were raised by the Kudelski and QuarksLab projects.</p>
<p><strong>QuarksLab found:</strong><br />
8 <span style="color: #cc284b;">Critical</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
2 <span style="color: #cca928;">Medium</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
20 <span style="color: #28cc57;">Low</span> or <span style="color: #28cc57;">Informational</span> Vulnerabilities / Concerns / Recommendations</p>
<hr />
<h4><span style="color: #cc284b;">One live-chain critical flaw identified and fixed:</span></h4>
<p>QuarksLab found a denial of service vulnerability that could allow an attacker to <strong>arbitrarily crash Monero nodes remotely</strong>, creating a vulnerability for a large-scale denial of service campaign for the Monero network and further potentially leading to a 51% attack and forced chain split, ultimately leading to double-spends.</p>
<p>Because this flaw impacted live code, OSTIF, QuarksLab, and the Monero team agreed to a disclosure embargo on this report until after the latest network upgrade that forced users to upgrade their nodes to patched code. The Monero XMR network is now safe from this flaw.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other serious bugs that were identified and fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>A lack of null value checks in the Bulletproofs proving algorithm.</em></span> The bulletproofs code relies on values being passed to it not being null, but did not proactively ensure that null values cannot be passed or checked for.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Dependent Generators in original java version of Bulletproofs are not secure.</em></span> The code had to be revised to improve number generation.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Overflow in double scalar multiplication.</em></span> The code needed to be patched to prevent the overflow of data.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Erroneous identity output in Bos-Coster multi-exponentiation.</em></span> The structure of the code could select the wrong input and return incorrect values.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Silently discarded element in Pippenger multi-exponentiation.</em></span> An optimization designed to discard large numbers of leading zeros could return the identity if a value of x^0 was entered into the function, meaning that the operation can return the identity unmodified. The optimization also had the additional issue of possibly discarding critical values for exact powers of two as inputs.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Invalid Verify input parameters.</em></span> There are no checks that the points provided are indeed points of Ed25519 and that they are on the main subgroup.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Key compromise in Schnorr signature.</em></span> In order to generate a valid Schnorr signature, the value k cannot be null or zero. If the value is null, an attacker can detect this and know the value of the key used to sign. If the value k is zero, then the value of the result is independent of the key and invalid. Checks needed to be added to the Schnorr signature to verify that the value k is not null or zero.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Failures in input size validation during (de)serialization.</em></span> A serialization error could allow an attacker to allocate up to 4GB of memory by initializing a value of 0 for nbp. Consequently, this can lead to memory being allocated for partially completed containers.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Failures in input type validation during (de)serialization.</em></span> A lack of robust checking for input type error from untrusted sources can lead to undesired behavior and error states.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Twenty other recommendations to improve security, robustness, practices, and performance.</em></span> The team also made a number of recommendations to code practices to improve the robustness of Monero code, to optimize performance, to improve error handling, and to reduce the attack surface of the software.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have completed the security review of the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)</a> for <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>1.1.1.</p>
<p>This security review was sponsored by <a href="https://privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>, <a href="https://expressvpn.com/">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a>, and the privacy community.</p>
<p>Random number generation is a crucial component in all cryptography, because the “randomness” of numbers is the mechanism that makes secret numbers hard to guess. Problems with number generation can lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator_attack">serious consequences</a>. When we learned that OpenSSL is getting a shiny new PRNG, we decided that it was crucial that we focus on making sure that the new code is as safe and robust as possible.</p>
<p>We had a team specifically review the new PRNG, which is also covered with a 2nd review by the cryptography review from QuarksLab. JP Aumasson and Antony Vennard carried out this component of our comprehensive review.</p>
<p>A total of ten issues were raised to improve the performance and/or randomness of the data created by the PRNG.</p>
<p>Because of these issues being found and corrected, OpenSSL’s new PRNG  is safer, performs better, and will provide safer crypto to the world!</p>
<hr />
<h2>Issues Identified in OpenSSLs New PRNG:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 1: Insufficient Privileges Check</strong><br />
The OpenSSL PRNG checks privileges before allowing random bytes to be called. This check did not account for any future changes to the structure of privileges in Linux, specifically, POSIX privileges in Fedora and its downstream neighbors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Status: Issue reported and patch issued here:<a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6993"> https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6993</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 2: Entropy Bytes Discarded</strong><br />
The OpenSSL PRNG was structured in such a way that it frequently threw away bytes if the function called too many or too few bytes of random data, leading to sub-optimal performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Status: Issue reported and patches issued here: <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6978">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6978 </a>and here <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6990">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6990</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 3: Insufficient Size Comparison</strong><br />
The OpenSSL PRNG function ctr_128 checked if exactly 128 bits of keylength were in use, instead of greater than 128 bits of keylength.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OpenSSL security team responded that these checks are sufficient in the context that they are used, because if the keylength doesn’t match the behavior of the software changes in a safe way, regardless of the keylength being larger or smaller than intended.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 4: Missing Null Pointer Checks in API Functions</strong><br />
The API for some PRNG functions fails to check for null pointers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OpenSSL security team responded that these checks are omitted by design. There is significant debate within the OpenSSL community on whether OpenSSL should employ null pointer checks or not. The full response by Matt Caswell of OpenSSL is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Passing NULL through in certain parameters is disallowed by the API. If you do it then you are incorrectly using the API &#8211; and the behavior is undefined.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Similarly if you pass NULL through to certain C library functions then you might see a crash.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s an ongoing debate within the OpenSSL community as to whether we should add NULL pointer checks or not. The big advantage to not having these checks (as per the argument of those in favour of not having them) is that you get immediate feedback that you&#8217;ve got a bug in your code, rather than potentially attempting to carry on even through an earlier operation failed. There is of course an overhead involved continually checking for NULL pointers through the whole library. Others take the opposite view that we should never allow a crash in the library if we can avoid it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The Debate continues with no clear consensus at the current time.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In any case not having NULL checks in the specific locations identified was a deliberate choice. No changes were made a result of this issue.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 5: Ordering of Seed Sources</strong><br />
The Linux getrandom() function is prioritized over all others, even if other sources of entropy are specified. It is recommended that OpenSSL mixes entropy sources if others are specified through XOR or some other mixing function.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OpenSSL team has requested that their exact response be shown here for clarity:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="im">For performance reasons, and also in order not to hog a scarce system resource (see e.g. issue #5849), we should not collect more than the requested amount of entropy and return as soon as we succeeded. Also, XORing the random data of different sources would not be necessary, because we use a derivation function: Concatenating the data is </span>sufficient, it will be mixed by the derivation function in the end. Note that if getrandom() fails for some reason then the other entropy sources will be used as fallbacks.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 6: Support for NONE Entropy Source</strong><br />
OpenSSL can be compiled with NONE as an entropy option. It is suggested that a warning be issued when a user attempts to do this as it is far less secure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Status: Issue reported and patch issued here: <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6980">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6980</a>and <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6981">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6981</a></p>
<p>The OpenSSL team has requested that their exact response be shown here for clarity:</p>
<blockquote><p>This option -with-rand-seed=none is only meant as last resort in cases where OpenSSL does not know which entropy source to use. Note, however, that it does *not* relax the requirement for seeding the DRBG properly, it only disables *automatic* (re-)seeding. The DRBG will remain in an uninitialized state unless the application seeds it manually using RAND_add(). Provided that the application seeds (and reseeds) the DRBG manually with sufficient entropy from a reliable entropy source, this should be just as good as automatic reseeding.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The -with-rand-seed option and the manual reseeding process is documented in detail in the RAND_DRBG(7) manual page.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 7: Role of Additional Data</strong><br />
OpenSSL allows optional personalization data to be added to the PRNG. This data is low-entropy and will not help security in any scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OpenSSL team disagreed with our analysis. The full response by Matt Caswell of OpenSSL is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a requirement of SP800-90A. The idea is to differentiate the output from different instantiations of the DRBG. See section 8.7.1 of that document for more details.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 8: UEFI Randomness Generation</strong><br />
UEFI and VXWorks only support the “none” option for generating random data in OpenSSL. This is far less secure than other options. It is suggested that the OpenSSL team look into options like EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL or just rdrand. Both options are superior to using “none” as an entropy source.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OpenSSL team wanted to contact the UEFI team to expand on this issue. As of this writing no changes have been made to our knowledge. We are waiting for additional comment from the OpenSSL Security Team on this issue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 9: Modern Windows Randomness Generation</strong><br />
Older versions of Windows used an old entropy source called CryptGenRandom(). This was replaced in Windows XP and above by RtlGenRandom() which is a more modern and better source of entropy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team agreed that this may be a good change. As of this writing no changes have been made.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue 10: Confusing Terminology in Documentation</strong><br />
OpenSSL comments and documentation use the words “entropy” and “entropy length” in non-standard ways, which can lead to confusion among developers trying to review and/or implement OpenSSL-based code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OpenSSL team said that the use of the words are in compliance with NISTs definition. The concern is that the NIST definition may be confusing to developers and lead to implementation errors for devs using OpenSSL as a library for their software.</p>
<p>The full report is below, please do not hot link to this report. Linking to this page instead allows us to bring more awareness to our cause! Thank you!</p>
