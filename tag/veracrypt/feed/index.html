										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>OSTIF is Partnering with the Internet Bug Bounty and HackerOne for Bug Bounties!</h1>
<p>The <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://ostif.org">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a></span> will be partnering with the <a href="https://internetbugbounty.org/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Internet Bug Bounty</span></a> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a></span> in a partnership that will get our supported projects listed on HackerOne with no overhead costs!</p>
<p><strong>HackerOne</strong> is the de-facto site for bug hunters around the world, with a community of thousands of skilled researchers at their disposal. This partnership brings an army of application security engineers and cryptographers to review our projects and submit bugs and receive bounties in an organized and effective way.</p>
<p>Our initial supported projects will be the <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">VeraCrypt project</span></a>, the <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenVPN project</span></a>, and the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL project</a></span> will be added after the results of our OpenSSL 1.1.1 audit are publicly available.</p>
<p>The bounties will initially match our own bug-bounty program, with up to $2500 for locating a bug (based on severity) and up to a $2500 bonus for submitting a fix to the project that prevents the problem from resurfacing through regression or new code introduced to the project. The fixes can include providing the tools to locate the bug (must be FOSS), providing a security patch, or improving security practices at the project. The fix must be accepted and integrated into the project to qualify. If a fix is provided and it is of low code quality, does not provide documentation or introduces other problems, the bonus may not qualify.</p>
<p>We are excited with this new partnership and it represents months of back-and-forth negotiations to get the terms of this deal to be ironed out.</p>
<p>I want to extend a special thank you to our primary sponsors that provided the bulk of the funding for this project that allowed it to happen. Thank you to <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Private Internet Access</span></a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Duck Duck Go</span></a>, <a href="https://openvpn.net/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OpenVPN Technologies</span></a>, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.ipredator.se/">iPredator</a></span> and <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ExpressVPN</span></a> for sponsoring our critical work to make the internet safer for all of us!</p>

This release included a number of new features including non-western developed encryption options, a boot loader that supports UEFI (modern BIOSes), and more.</p>
<p>QuarksLab found:<br />
8 <span style="color: #cc284b;">Critical</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
3 <span style="color: #cca928;">Medium</span> Vulnerabilities<br />
15 <span style="color: #28cc57;">Low</span> or <span style="color: #28cc57;">Informational</span> Vulnerabilities / Concerns</p>
<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with the release of VeraCrypt 1.19 which fixes the vast majority of these high priority concerns. Some of these issues have not been fixed due to high complexity for the proposed fixes, but workarounds have been presented in the documentation for VeraCrypt.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Fixes:</strong></h2>
<p>Because of this audit, VeraCrypt has issued a number of fixes to both the application and the bootloader in 1.19.</p>
<p><strong>The fixes include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Removal of the GOST 28147-89 encryption option entirely</em>.</span> The implementation was unsafe. Functionality for decryption of volumes that used this cipher is still in place, but new volumes cannot be created using this cipher.</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Removal of XZip and XUnzip</em>.</span> These were replaced with modern and more secure zip libraries (libzip).</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 5.1</em></span> (password length can be determined in classic bootloader).</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 7.1</em></span> for the new bootloader. (keystrokes not erased after authentication)</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 7.2</em></span> for the new bootloader. (sensitive data not correctly erased)</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 7.3</em></span> for the new bootloader. (memory corruption)</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Fixes implemented for the vulnerability described in section 7.4</em></span> for the new bootloader. (null pointer, dead code, inconsistent data reads by ConfigRead, bad pointer in EFIGetHandles, null pointer dereference in the graphic library.)</li>
<li><span style="color: #cc284b;"><em>Updates to user documentation for other vulnerabilities that can be closed by user practices</em>.</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>VeraCrypt is much safer after this audit, and the fixes applied to the software mean that the world is safer when using this software.</h3>
<p>Please <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://ostif.org/donate-to-ostif/">donate to OSTIF</a></span> if you want us to continue this valuable work. We plan to continue this project indefinitely, as long as the community continues to support us. Every donation makes the internet stronger, and safer.</p>
<p>I’d also like to extend a special thank you to Fred, Jean-Baptiste, and Marion at QuarksLab for conducting this audit, to Mounir at Idrix for his enthusiastic participation and continued development of this crucial open-source software, and to<span style="color: #289dcc;"> <a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://vikingvpn.com/">VikingVPN</a></span> and <span style="color: #289dcc;"><a style="color: #289dcc;" href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a></span> and all of our individual donors for the funding to make this audit possible. We have all made the digital world a little bit safer for all of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://ostif.org/?p=492">OSTIF + QuarksLab Audit of VeraCrypt Completed &#8211; Phase II Begins</a></h1>
<p>The audit of VeraCrypt has been completed, and the final report is being created over the coming days. The VeraCrypt developers have the preliminary results and we are working with both VeraCrypt and QuarksLab on the timetable for releasing results.</p>
<h2>Why aren&#8217;t results released immediately?</h2>
<p>In order to ensure that the public is as safe as possible, public release of the audit information is not released until the developers of the software are confident that all bugs are fixed. This delay is to ensure that an updated version of the software is available simultaneously with the release of the audit results.</p>
<p>It is also OSTIF policy that we do not handle &#8220;zero day&#8221; vulnerability information. This both releases us from liability if a zero day were to go public, and allows developers and donors to trust that we are not misusing or selling vulnerability information. The primary purpose of these audits is to improve the security software, and our policies reflect that.</p>
<p>We are working closely with QuarksLab and VeraCrypt to ensure that as soon as VeraCrypt is ready, we will simultaneously release the results of the audit on all three of our websites.</p>
<p>Check this site for updates!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OSTIF is proud to announce that we have come to an agreement to fully fund an audit of VeraCrypt. Using funds that were donated by <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href="https://vikingvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VikingVPN</a>, we plan to hire <a href="http://quarkslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuarksLab</a> to go over the code and search for vulnerabilities and backdoors.</p>
<p><a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a> is a crucial piece of open-source software that can encrypt any storage medium with powerful and highly tamper-resistant encryption that greatly enhances the personal security of anyone that uses it. An audit of the code brings fresh professional perspectives and a deep analysis of the code to search for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>As of our agreement today, QuarksLab will be executing their auditing work in mid-August with completion and results before mid-September. The team has been instructed to give any results of this audit directly to the lead developer of VeraCrypt using heavily encrypted communications. This is to prevent their research from leaking zero-day vulnerabilities to the public, and so that the OSTIF does not have access to the results ahead of the public.</p>
<p>Once all parties are satisfied that any major vulnerabilities have been patched, we plan to post the results of this audit to all three of our websites (OSTIF.org, QuarksLab, and VeraCrypt) simultaneously.</p>
<p>This audit is very exciting for us, as it is the first time that we are converting promises and goals into results! We look forward to bringing the open-source community and the public closer together, and we are committed to fighting hard for the technical solution to the privacy problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TrueCrypt &#8211; The venerable full disk and container encryption software that was abandoned by its developers in 2014, was believed to be secure, despite the development of the software ending. This was the consensus among the security community because the software had been audited by iSec (a subsidiary of NCC). They had taken separate looks at the boot loader and the application code and not found any serious security flaws.</p>
<p>This strengthened the community&#8217;s trust in the software and people continued to use the software, confident that the software was largely bug-free.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and <a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Forshaw</a> from <a href="http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google&#8217;s Project Zero</a> has taken a look at the source code, and found two flaws that existed throughout the iSec audit. One is a critical EOP (escalation of privilege) bug that would allow an attacker to use the TrueCrypt application to get elevated access to a computer that has the software installed. While this would not give access to the containers on the Windows PC and the data would remain encrypted, it is only one additional step now to bypass that hurdle. You could, for example, install a keylogger on the machine and use that to get access to the passwords on the machine without the user&#8217;s knowledge, thus breaking the encryption of containers.</p>
<p><a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a> has patched the flaws, and the current version is now safe from the EOP attack. Make sure you update VeraCrypt to the current version if you haven&#8217;t already. If you are still running TrueCrypt, now is the time to run for the hills as this flaw is a deal-breaker. Having the TrueCrypt software installed is a direct security risk on all Windows systems.</p>
<p>This chain of events highlights the need for support from organizations like ours and people like you. You need as many eyes on critical security software as possible. Our efforts to draw more skilled developers into reviewing the code, both through <a href="https://ostif.org/security-audits-what-they-are-and-why-they-matter/">bounties</a> and <a href="https://ostif.org/security-audits-what-they-are-and-why-they-matter/">direct funding of audits</a>, is a crucial step in keeping software as secure as possible.</p>
<p>You can read more about the new flaws here: CVE-2015-7358 and CVE-2015-7359 (full disclosure has not occurred yet, this will be updated with links after full disclosure)</p>
