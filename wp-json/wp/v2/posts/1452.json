Bulletproofs is a trustless proofs setup that is substantially smaller than the current Borromean style range proofs that are currently used, promising to make Monero transactions 10-20% of their current size.<\/p>\n<p>Kudelski found that the code was largely clean and that the C implementation that Monero has developed from the original Java code is suitable for use. Their findings did include 4 low severity bugs that have been patched, as well as a number of informational issues.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>The bugs that were fixed:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #cc284b;\">BP-F-001: Unsafe use of environment variables<\/span><br \/>\nPatch: This function no longer uses environment variables to set this value, as\u00a0<span style=\"color: #28cc57;\">patched in commit 68f7606<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #cc284b;\">BP-F-002: Lack of input validation in prover<\/span><br \/>\nPatch: Input scalars are now checked to ensure they are within the proper range in the prove and verify routines, as\u00a0<span style=\"color: #28cc57;\">patched in 68f7606<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #cc284b;\">BP-F-003: Integer overflow in bulletproof L size computation<\/span><br \/>\nPatch: Correct boundary checks have been added to avoid the overflow, as\u00a0<span style=\"color: #28cc57;\">patched in commit 68f7606<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #cc284b;\">BP-O-008: Undefined behavior shifting signed value<\/span><br \/>\nPatch: The function has been rewritten using a ternary operator in\u00a0<span style=\"color: #28cc57;\">commit 68f7606<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This public disclosure of these vulnerabilities coincides with updates to the bulletproofs code which fixes all of the high priority concerns.<\/p>\n<p>This is the first of two audits that are sponsored by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/lab.getmonero.org\/\">Monero Research Lab<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Monero\/\">The Monero Community<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.privateinternetaccess.com\/\">Private Internet Access<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ostif.org\/\">OSTIF<\/a>.
