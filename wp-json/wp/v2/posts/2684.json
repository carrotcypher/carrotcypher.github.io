Upon review, it was found that slf4j has a very small attack surface area and does not support post-processing of logging messages that may be cause for security concern, such as the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/logging.apache.org\/log4j\/2.x\/security.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">log4j vulnerabilities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published in 2021. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results of the security audit are three (1 Low Risk, 2 Informational) findings, a documented threat model, and a Supply Chain Security review against SLSA. As a result of this review, slf4j, logback, and reload4j (a new fork of log4j 1.x with security fixes) are now reproducible builds, which substantially increases the difficulty of a supply-chain attack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All findings identified through this security audit have been fixed and validated. See below for the full report.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A huge thank you to Ceki G\u00fclc\u00fc of slf4j for actively participating in the audit process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special thanks to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openssf.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenSSF<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for supporting the work and to Google for funding the audit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proactive security audits go a long way in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities.
