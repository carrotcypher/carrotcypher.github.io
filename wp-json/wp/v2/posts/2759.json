CloudEvents is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cloudevents.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specification<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for describing event data in a common way that simplifies event declaration and delivery across services, platforms, and beyond. CloudEvents has a robust <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/cloudevents\/spec\/blob\/main\/docs\/contributors.md\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">network of contributors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and active development as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Security Assessment took place in September 2022, in which a team of two experts conducted a security review, with four person-weeks of effort. A combination of testing was performed, including dynamic and static analysis of the SDKs and manual review of the specification.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of security audits is to find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before attackers exploit them, as well as to identify opportunities to harden a project\u2019s implementation and processes to counter vulnerabilities in the future. The CloudEvents Assessment did not uncover any significant flaws or defects that could impact system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The notable findings in the review were that some of the SDKs were using outdated dependencies that needed critical security updates, leaving some of them with multiple outdated and vulnerable dependencies. This is a common problem in software, and highlights the importance of better dependency management.\u00a0 The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/deps.dev\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deps.dev<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tool provides insight on project dependencies. Furthermore, the CloudEvents Assessment highlighted the need for adding fuzzing tests to SDKs and potentially adding various SDKs to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/google\/oss-fuzz\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSS-fuzz<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-party Security Audits are an important tool for improving a project\u2019s security posture.
