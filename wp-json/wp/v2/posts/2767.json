In development since 1998, curl is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. Curl is used in just about everything: cars, television sets, routers, printers, audio equipment, mobile phones, tablets, media players and is the Internet transfer engine for thousands of software applications in over ten billion installations. It\u2019s even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/daniel.haxx.se\/blog\/2021\/04\/19\/mars-2020-helicopter-contributor\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deployed on Mars<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The security review of curl was facilitated by OSTIF and sponsored by the Open Source Security Foundation (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openssf.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenSSF<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) in an effort to improve the security of this critical project in the open source ecosystem. The engagement involved a team of four consultants conducting code review for approximately six engineer-weeks of effort. A total of 12 issues were addressed, including 2 High Severity findings. The technical work of the review was led by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/trailofbits\/publications#security-reviews\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trail of Bits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bug fixes were validated and patched as part of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/curl.se\/dev\/release-procedure.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">curl release schedule<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The planned release for December 21, 2022, included all of the fixes and improvements made to curl as a result of this engagement. A detailed synopsis of the security improvements to curl can be found in the reports under <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summary of Findings <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fix Review Results<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another significant accomplishment from this engagement was a component-focused threat model for curl and libcurl. Published as a separate report, the effort involved a team of two engineers focused on the identification of security control flaws that could result in a compromise. This focused effort uncovered one design-level issue that could lead to vulnerabilities along with multiple security improvements. Threat model reports like this one can be used by developer and maintainer communities to better understand components, trust zones, and threat actors and gain a deeper understanding of how to use a project like curl.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curl team demonstrated a strong commitment to improving security posture by actively participating in the audit process and collaborating with the audit team during the review and threat modeling exercise. Curl is a good example of a critical open source project. It has been in development for over 20 years thanks largely in part to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.haxx.se\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haxx<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a group of open source developers and hackers in Sweden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSTIF is extremely grateful for the funding and support from OpenSSF to help make this critical project more secure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results can be viewed in full detail at the following links:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curl Security Assessment Full Report &#8211; Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Assurance-Report-cURL-Code-Review-Testing-Analysis-Fix-Review-2022-2.pdf\">https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Assurance-Report-cURL-Code-Review-Testing-Analysis-Fix-Review-2022-2.pdf<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curl Threat Model Full Report &#8211; Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/cURL-Threat-Model-Report-Fix-Review-2022.pdf\">https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/cURL-Threat-Model-Report-Fix-Review-2022.pdf<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We thank David A.
