A total of fifteen fixes were implemented as a result of this engagement, including fixes for two upstream issues in golang itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The security review included building six new fuzzers for sensitive functions in Istio, manual review of the Istio codebase, and recommendations for improving the supply chain security of Istio using the SLSA model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The notable findings in this review include multiple vectors for resource exhaustion, arbitrary file writes, TOCTOU issues, and recommendations to move away from a deprecated protobuf library.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This project resulted in 13 direct code changes, 6 improved tests, and efforts to complete a move from \/gogo\/protobuf (which is no longer maintained) to \/golang\/protobuf. Additionally, Istio added Depguard to the project in order to detect any future use of deprecated or unsafe dependencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally as a result of this audit, a problem was discovered in golang h2c that was both a resource exhaustion and request smuggling vector that could affect many projects downstream, resulting in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cve.org\/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41721\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.cve.org\/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41721<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
