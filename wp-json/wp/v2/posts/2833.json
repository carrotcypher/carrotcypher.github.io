The funding from AWS will help OSTIF scale our ability to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical open source projects. In particular, the goal is to improve the sustainability of upstream projects commonly used in the open source ecosystem.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c2022 proved to be an impactful year for OSTIF, as we executed over 20 security engagements for critical open source projects; resulting in over 35 Critical\/High Vulnerability patches and upwards of 165 total security improvements. Approximately 50 automated security tools, such as fuzzers and CI implementations, were developed to continuously monitor these projects, providing long-term benefits to security posture. The support from AWS will allow us to continue to do that into 2023 and scale our ability to help critical open source projects that everyone depends on.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Amir Montazery, Managing Director, OSTIF<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCreating healthy and sustainable open source communities is the guiding principle behind our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open source investments.
