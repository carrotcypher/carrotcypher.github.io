A mature project like simpejson has many maintainers and contributors over its long life, yet there were still minor fissures in the code that were addressed and patched. The efforts provided by a skilled third-party reviewer can help mature projects further their security concerns and goals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We thank X41 for their continued work with OSTIF in helping open source projects navigate the complex security space.

The OSTIF funded security audit of simplejson performed by X41 D-Sec was thorough; it identified potential security issues (minor, in this case) and included several specific recommendations for security hardening that will help the project remain safe to use. Even as a solo maintainer, it was a breeze to work with OSTIF and X41 D-Sec. The entire engagement from their initial email to the release of simplejson v3.9.1 took less than a month, just a few emails and one meeting on my end before receiving the initial report. I&#8217;d highly recommend working with OSTIF to other open source maintainers, and if I was still a decision maker at a corporation I&#8217;d devote resources to sponsoring this important work!\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Bob Ippolito, simplejson\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full audit report is here: <a href=\"https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/X41-OSTIF-simplejson-audit-2023.pdf\">https:\/\/ostif.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/X41-OSTIF-simplejson-audit-2023.pdf<\/a><br \/>\nX41 has a blog post about the project here with more details: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.x41-dsec.de\/security\/news\/2023\/04\/26\/simplejson\/\">https:\/\/www.x41-dsec.de\/security\/news\/2023\/04\/26\/simplejson\/<\/a><br \/>\nMore info from the simplejson github: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/simplejson\/simplejson\/pull\/313\">https:\/\/github.com\/simplejson\/simplejson\/pull\/313<\/a><br \/>\nMore info from Bob Ippolito, current simplejson lead maintainer: <a href=\"https:\/\/bob.ippoli.to\/archives\/2023\/04\/26\/simplejson-audit\/\">https:\/\/bob.ippoli.to\/archives\/2023\/04\/26\/simplejson-audit\/<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OSTIF is pleased to announce that another audit has reached publication!
