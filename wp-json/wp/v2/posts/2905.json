The audit found six inconsistencies during the process. Three vulnerabilities were rated as medium, three others as informational. Alongside performing static manual code review, the X41 team implemented and customized AFL++ fuzzers during this audit. Recently, AFL++ fuzzers have been made to support command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing, which was important to this audit as c-ares is made up of multiple CLI tooling components in its code base. While the audit particularly focused on memory corruption vulnerabilities which are common in C libraries, two of the medium vulnerabilities were categorized as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cwe.mitre.org\/data\/definitions\/330.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CWE 330<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Use of Insufficiently Random Values.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are so grateful to the c-ares team, particularly their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/c-ares\/c-ares\/releases\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nine contributors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as X41\u2019s fantastic staff for their efforts on this project. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Web Services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sponsored this work and we are deeply appreciative of their support of open source security.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>\u201cGenerally speaking, OSTIF as well as the maintainers of the library deserve a lot of praise for their overall support and assistance.
