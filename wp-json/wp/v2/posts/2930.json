Fuzzers were mainly used for preliminary scoping of the source code. It is hypothesized by the X41 team that while it is possible to perform fuzz testing deeper in go-tuf, fuzzing efforts are best focused at detecting irregularities in implementations. During the process of code review performed by X41, one medium, one low, and four unranked vulnerabilities were identified.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The medium criticality with two confirmed attack scenarios was classified as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cwe.mitre.org\/data\/definitions\/59.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CWE 59, Improper Link Resolution Before File Access<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which could allow a bad actor to place their own links into the repository. The low severity criticality was architectural, dealing with possible untied updates or metadata.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSTIF is grateful to our frequent collaborators, X41 D-sec, for their work and report on go-tuf.
