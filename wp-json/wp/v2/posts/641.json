It is available for all versions of Windows, OSX, Android, iOS, Chrome OS, most versions of Linux, and BSD. It is used worldwide by businesses to protect information that goes over insecure networks, and increasingly it is used by private users who want to protect their information from cybercrime and surveillance. OpenVPN is powerful, free, and used by millions of people. An audit of OpenVPN will add further integrity to the software, allowing users around the world to trust that the software is strong and resistant to intrusion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>OpenVPN version 2.4 has just entered beta, with a full release to soon follow. As the first major revision of the software to be released in years, it has a huge number of bug fixes and feature changes under the hood, giving an audit a great opportunity to review these new areas of code that will likely persist for years with small changes until OpenVPN 2.5 is ready to go. It is the most effective time for an audit to take place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why OSTIF?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are an independent advocate for free and open software that improves the security of users around the world. We are efficient, open, and ready to tackle the problems that face free software. We have just completed our<a href=\"https:\/\/ostif.org\/the-veracrypt-audit-results\/\"> audit of VeraCrypt 1.18<\/a> a few months ago, and we are striking while the iron is hot to continue making harder and more powerful security software for all of us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Early credits for groups that are contributing to the effort:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Leading the effort<\/strong><\/em>, the groups that have made significant contributions to the cause:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/ipredator.se\/\">iPredator<\/a> has contributed 10 BTC or about $7700<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/openvpn.net\/\">OpenVPN Technologies Inc.<\/a>\u00a0has contributed $5000<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.perfect-privacy.com\/\">Perfect Privacy<\/a> has contributed $3500<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nvpn.net\/\">nVpn.net<\/a> has contributed $2650<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/expressvpn.com\/\">ExpressVPN<\/a> has contributed $2500<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartdnsproxy.com\/\">SmartDNSProxy<\/a> has contributed $2500<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/ivpn.net\/\">iVPN<\/a> has contributed $2100<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/vikingvpn.com\">VikingVPN<\/a> has contributed $2000, making their total contribution to OSTIF $2000.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/zorrovpn.com\">ZorroVPN<\/a> has contributed $1600<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.securevpn.to\/\">SecureVPN.to<\/a> has contributed $1500<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/vpn.ac\/\">VPN.ac<\/a> has contributed $1500<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.getflix.com.au\/\">GetFlix<\/a> has contributed $1350<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/cryptostorm.is\/\">CryptoStorm<\/a> has contributed $1337<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.trickbyte.com\/\">TrickByte<\/a> has contributed $1150<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nordvpn.com\/\">NordVPN<\/a> has contributed $1000<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackvpn.com\/\">BlackVPN<\/a> has contributed $1000<\/p>\n<p>Also contributing to the effort:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/fatdisco.com\/\">FatDisco<\/a> has contributed $650<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bestsmartdns.com\/\">BestSmartDNS<\/a> has contributed $600<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/strongvpn.com\">StrongVPN<\/a> has contributed $500<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/windscribe.com\/\">Windscribe<\/a> has contributed $500<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/celo.net\/\">Celo.net<\/a> has contributed $400<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bolehvpn.net\/\">BolehVPN<\/a> has contributed $300<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/thatoneprivacysite.net\/\">ThatOnePrivacySite<\/a> has contributed $200.
